My sister and I just recently purchased innerwear from here (22/4/2023) and the employees there are quite alright, I manage to find my size but my sister took some time in finding it, which she later noticed its not the right size for her on that day when we got back home.

I understand its her incompetence when it comes to choosing something you wear everyday and still able to choose wrong. So we went back to the store for an exchange (24/4/2023) and it's a different staff this time. Though I find this employee to be somewhat irritated due to her tone when she's serving. But the biggest problem was that she secretly CUT OFF the price tag after my sister had finally done choosing the right size WITHOUT informing us and for me, that just leaves a sour taste in my mouth.

I believe staff have to at least inform the customers that they will cut off the price tag due to whatever reasons presents. Either its because customers can only exchange product once or any other reason at all, for the staff to cut off the price tag like that is just another stamp approval of me not visiting this store anymore.

I'm not sure about the name of the employee but I believe the Person in charge can find out who that is.

This lead to a wild spread rebellion spread across the nation. The founders of this food establishment found the best Asian fried chicken, believe or not, in New York’s city on the subway scene. This is where it all began. Their original chicken recipe is more well-known have a fiery sensation which is as intense as their hot and spicy sauce. From there on, they spread their wings to other regions such as Malaysia, Indonesia and Australia to share what they believed.
How do they make their chicken taste so good? Their chicken is specially cooked to using their own house recipe which resulted in an awesome fried chicken that's packed with loads of flavour. They also use only fresh, locally sourced free-range chicken in kitchens which definitely speaks of quality of their own food. What makes their chicken recipe unique, spicy and crispy, it is cooked with natural herbs and spices, with zero artificial flavourings. In addition to that there is no MSG and instead they use naturally fermented soy sauces that packs a punch, offering their food in the most natural way possible.
Their signature Soy Garlic and Hot & Spicy sauces are made the good old fashioned way, fermented naturally using a traditional Asian method (soy beans, water, 5 months of Malaysian sun) and natural herbs and spices. Not only their chicken is great but they also offer a variety of things such as their delicious burgers and sandwiches, seafood and salad to appeal to many. Now that is available in our mall, this is a great addition for everyone to enjoy a chicken recipe originated from Singapore.

Unfortunately, the dish was underwhelming. The squid was not cooked properly—it was still rubbery and slightly wet, which made it unpleasant to eat.

I informed the staff about the issue, but to my disappointment, they didn’t take any meaningful action. Instead, they just took a photo of the dish. I didn’t want to cause a fuss, as I understand they were busy, but I still left feeling let down by both the food and the lack of response.

For the price, I expected better quality and service. I hope the restaurant takes this feedback seriously and makes improvements, both in the kitchen and in their customer service.

If you’re on a shopping spree, you won’t want to skip this super cute store that has so much to offer that it’s established itself as ‘a girl’s favourite shopping destination’. Hailing from its headquarters in Hong Kong, the brand started out as a youthful and energetic lingerie brand founded by Erik Ryd, a Swedish entrepreneur with a well-known lingerie manufacturing business in Asia. A few years later, the brand expanded its range of apparel from its adorable to sexy lingerie line, to include nightwear, active wear, denim, tops, dresses, pants, loungewear and accessories.
As this shopping haven expands to become one of the fastest-growing fashion brands in Asia, it now has more than 200 outlets and counting all over. Lion is proud to say that the brand’s first outlet on Malaysian shores opened right here at Sunway Pyramid in 2019! When they first opened their doors to all fashion-adoring shoppers, Lion was curious to find out what the intriguing name of their store meant. Turns out, the meaning behind 6IXTY8IGHT’s unique name has its roots in Chinese numerology. Since Cantonese is the main dialect spoken in Hong Kong, their pronunciation for the numbers 6 and 8 have phonetic similarities to a phrase resembling “Forever luck!”.
There’s definitely something for everyone here. With their wide range of lingerie that’s either cute and quirky, or sexy and alluring, it’s amazing how comfortable and affordable it is too - who ever said you can’t have the best of both worlds? Even their outerwear is nothing short of stylish chic, great to mix and match for every occasion – whether it’s that perfect date outfit, or for a day out with friends, or even to your office.

The material they use is generally cotton with nylon/rayon/polyester knitted mix, slightly thick but which gives the materials a better fall/structure to the body.

She’s amazing! 👍👍👍 - a month ago | (1⭐) I’m extremely disappointed with my recent manicure experience at this salon. From the beginning, I felt something was off, but I didn’t expect to be left so frustrated by the end of the session. The technician didn’t inform me that she was a trainee until the very end, which would have been helpful to know upfront. The lack of experience was painfully evident throughout the entire process.

The session took over 2 and a half hours, which I found completely unnecessary, especially since I was only getting a basic gel manicure with no color. I had specifically asked for nail extensions prior, but I was told that they would take too long. However, even with just a simple gel application, the technician insisted that coloured gel wouldn’t look good on my short nails, and in the end, my nails were actually cut even shorter during the process.

The results were far from what I expected. My nails look uneven, and the entire experience was frustrating and uncomfortable. I left feeling like I had wasted both my time and money.

To make matters worse, the next day, I noticed that my thumb nail wasn’t even coated with the last layer of gel. I returned to the salon to ask them to at least put on the top coat, but when they did, it ended up looking completely different in color because the worker allegedly forgot what shade she had used. It’s hard to believe that such an oversight could happen at a salon, especially with something as simple as a top coat.

I really wish the salon had been more transparent about the technician’s skill level beforehand. I won’t be returning or recommending this place to anyone. - a month ago | (1⭐) Went here for gel manicure . It cost me rm78. But the service is lousy. Such a lazy and rude staff.

The waffles were unappealing, appearing artificial and were served cold and overly crispy. The ice cream was haphazardly presented in fragments rather than in a complete, rounded scoop. Additionally, the curly fries were served cold, suggesting they had been sitting out for hours. The root beer float lacked fizziness and was served without a straw, which was inconvenient. Furthermore, the spoon provided for the float was incorrect; it wasn’t the long spoon typically used for such drinks.

A big shout out to stylist Vaan. He’s so meticulous and he managed to do all of the items within 2 hours as I have a flight to catch. Every step of the chemical treatment there’s scalp protector and additional ampoule to not be so painful for my scalp during the chemical processes and he kept checking on my hair and whether I can take the pain.  He is also very good at picking colours- I only do cool tone colours and without me saying he already mixed the silver-gray as a colour to uniformly tone my colour.

While most people may not have heard or seen it, those who has gone there at least once will drop by again when they can. Unlike most other eateries in Sunway Pyramid, ABC One Cafeteria prides itself in providing a down-to-earth, affordable meal that is devoid of the usual drapperies of fancy eatings. Customers can look forward to a hearty meal of staple local delicacies such as fried beehoon, fried rice, mee goreng, nasi kandar, fried chicken and fish, cooked Malay dishes, and occasionally a variety of 'kuih-muihs' to wrap up your meal.
Each item are resonable priced and well seasoned to entice the appetite and still be wallet-friendly, with a slight variation in menu on a daily basis to encourage repeat customers to pop by during their lunch or tea breaks. ABC One Cafeteria is also capable of catering to events that has been pre-arranged with their cooks. Customers can provide a list of their requests and have a discussion with the team to know if their desired menu can be prepared for a very reasonable price.
Do drop by the ABC One Cafe one day for a simple meal, that is both satisfying and filling!",B1.001 (Basement 1),"(4⭐) It's a good establishment if you're looking for cheap food in sunway pyramid. It's a lil bit hidden but it's right next to a lift. Do note that this place is self-serve so it's not your usual mamak where the waiter will come to serve you. Since the staff's number are a lil bit limited, it might take a while if you're ordering food that need some cooking (mi goreng mamak etc.) If you're looking for something filling (and you want it fast), I would recommend you to order their nasi campur. The payment method here are by card, duitnow qr (you have to scan their duitnow qr) and also cash. The location has some echo to it, so you might have to speak louder when ordering your food/chatting with you companions.  Overall, I had a good experience dining here, though I wish the staff had called me promptly when my tapau-ed food was ready.

#BeautyTreats",LG1.96A (Lower Ground 1 Floor),"(5⭐) This perfume store is a local brand that sells quality perfume.
I remember back in those days when the company started, they used to have charity, perfume bottles drawn by down syndrome kids. But now it's more of generic packaging.

Their shower gel smell really good.
For the perfume, they're selling EDT and EDP.
Angelique smell really calming and the smell is not that bold. Rosette smells like just rose scent. Magnolia is very popular with it's fruity and flowery scent.
The price of their products is moderate and more near to commoners price range.
So if you want a special memorable gift that is affordable, this local brand is really a good choice. - 9 months ago | (5⭐) Steel Magnolia. Nice and Pleasing Parfume

•	Convenient Layout: Despite its size, the mall is well-organized, making navigation easy.

The sales person initially encouraged to go for 2 items for 30% discount. After that, ask us why not we go for more, as if we go for more than 2 items, we will get additional 10% discount on top of the 30% discount. So, because of this, we get the kids to try on their shoes and the kids are in love with the sport shoes. However, to our much disappointment, when we are about to pay, we feel weird, that the calculation didnt match what we were told, and the sales person just told us that, sorry, the promotion had ended a day earlier, but how can? as a big company did such a mistake. We still ended up buying because we didnt want the kids to be upset after choosing and trying and confirming their shoes, we ended paying RM87x instead of RM79x. This is really so unprofessional way, how can the staff be so unprofessional, or the company no notification of the promotion ended? I appreciate Anta to reply us for this matter. We were regular customer of ANTA, but truly disappointed with this misinformation and service yesterday at Sunway Pyramid branch. - 4 months ago | (5⭐) Great location and good service.

Her cutting skill was good. However it will be better if she could put on a friendly smile. She looks very stern.
Anyway I'm happy with my hairdo for RM40. Is worth it. - 2 months ago | (5⭐) a very much thank you to stylist Anne which attended to my hairstyling. Not only Anne give a good haircut, she attentive and provides a good chat. Anne also recommend treatment for my hair, which after a few days my hair really did felt better and much stronger. I’ve also bought a product recommended by her, it does help. Overall a great experience. - 5 months ago | (1⭐) I went to APT for a hair wash and normal dry. I went here because I've been to APT Salon several times when I lived in Penang and the service and quality there was good. And even prices were very reasonable.
Over here, in Sunway Pyramid, they charged me 60+ RM for my thin hair. I was still okay to pay because I wanted good service.
The person who washed my hair couldn't understand a word of English. He took me directly to the hair wash basin for the wash, unlike how it used to be done at the Penang branch. Before starting I asked him to shampoo only once as my hair tends to get too dry with double shampooing. But he went ahead and shampooed twice anyway.
Then when he was applying conditioner I requested that he leave it on for a couple of minutes so it can actually condition my hair and he said ok, but washed it off in less than 15 seconds. 🤷‍♀️
Then, while blowdrying he used the high heat blast from the very beginning and kept bringing it very close to my scalp. And he kept focussing on the back of my scalp while the front was just airdrying and setting to become kind-of messy-frizzy..
After he was done I had to ask him to apply hair serum, and That's something that he should have done without me asking considering how sadly he had blow-dried my hair.
After the wash my scalp has been completely damaged. It's been almost 3 weeks now since this hair wash and my scalp has not recovered yet. The back portion of my scalp is still soar and extremely itchy and i usually never have an itchy scalp. I've never faced this issue ever before. I'm not sure if it's bad products used or bad technique or both together, but it's ruined my scalp. All I wanted was a relaxing hair wash. But instead left disappointed with a damaged scalp.
One thing salon Staff should understand is that everyone coming there has different hair types and should be handled according to that. ONE METHOD/FORMULA DOESN'T FIT ALL when it comes to hair. Especially in Malaysia where you find a mix of people from so many ethnicities it's expected all the more.
Anyway all in all, bad service and disappointing experience.
I will definitely not return to this salon again - in the last week | (5⭐) Did my hair (colour and cut) with Bryan. Was lucking when i came walkin he’s attended me. Love the consultation and also the result! Will definitely come again 👍🏼 - in the last week | (1⭐) Serena i really don't understand what she is thinking, doesn't she feel guilty for giving someone else a haircut like this?

The staff truly knows how to explain and offer recommendations, which improved my impression of their products and brand even though I don't know a lot about the brand. Now, when it comes to hair care products, Aveda is one of my fave brands. Along with a soothing shoulder massage, their scalp check treatment was very useful in establishing the health of my scalp. My overall satisfaction with their services and goods is excellent. - a year ago | (1⭐) I recently visited this establishment for a hair and scalp review, but unfortunately, the experience was not pleasant. The staff who greeted us had a sullen face and made us feel unwelcome right from the start. This was disappointing as it's not the kind of experience you want when seeking professional advice.

During the review, the staff member assigned to us couldn't provide much helpful advice regarding the scalp issue we were experiencing. It was clear that more training is needed for the staff to be able to give expert advice to customers.

After we decided to purchase a few items, we noticed a change in behavior from one of the staff members who became friendlier. However, the other staff member still maintained an unprofessional and unfriendly demeanor, which was a letdown.

Overall, the experience was not great, and the staff's behavior was disappointing. We hope that management will take appropriate action and ensure that their staff are better trained to provide customers with a welcoming and professional experience. - a year ago | (1⭐) I went there for a scalp check but the promoter said they don’t  provide that particular facility in Aveda sunway pyramid , and the best part is they had a board promoting the scalp and hair check.

If you look different that doesn't mean you are different from others finally what matters is your character. A stranger can't judge you by your appearance. No matter your age or gender, your body’s largest organ is your skin. If you want your skin especially on the face to look its best and stay healthy, you need to take care of it. Healthy, good looking skin begins with skin care. Facials are an essential ingredient of your overall skin care program and you will love the benefits of facials. A facial is a spa therapy and massage that leaves your skin cleaner, softer, younger, and truly transformed. Facials can help clear clogged pores, quench parched skin and remove dead cells. Facials involve some massage which aids in blood circulation and lymphatic drainage. The facial massage also helps to relax facial muscles which can slow the onset of wrinkles on the face. Puffiness reduction, sagging in the face and skin cell renewal are additional benefits from these massage techniques. Facials help reduce the impact of sun exposure, smoking and other environmental factors as well as incorrect product use. During your facial, your licensed aesthetic, will recommend appropriate skin care for home use to help you continue the benefits of our facial and correct ongoing skin care issues. Adonis, with natural skin care, you don’t have to worry about the added chemicals you aren’t sure are safe.

Aeroline Penang—Corus Hotel KL

Trip started PROMPTLY at 8:30 AM, no delays. Driver and crew, Faiz was very nice. They helped with check in, seat directory and baggage. The driver was very skilful when navigating through the narrow roads. In one instance, it was a 2 lane road and there was one car illegally parked.  The driver still managed to drive by without even needing to reverse.

At around 8:35, Faiz came down the row with comfy blue blankets and headphones.  The headphones worked great with the on-board entertainment (OBE). The OBE was equipped with many movies and songs, of different genres.

At about 9, Faiz served food to us. It had spicy rice, potato wedges and egg. The food was 9/10, tasty! He also served hot drinks which also tasted great!

The rest of the trip, he went around a few times to collect trash.

There was one stop at a fuel station for 15 MINUTES break.

At about 1PM-1:30PM, we arrived at Corus Hotel. Driver was nice enough to let me take videos of the bus.

2 mineral water bottles with Aeroline branding is provided.

Overall, awesome ride. It deserves more than 5 stars!

Traditional favorites have long ingrained itself into the taste bud of every person, regardless of which social class you are in, be it the rich man and his craving for the decadent roadside Ramly burger or a simple office worker looking forward to a hearty lunch of char koey teow.
Ah Cheng Laksa is one of those establishments that brings out the best in a local delicacy and transport the eater on a journey away from the stress of the day. Offering a varied menu of local mains and side dishes, the main item to stand out is the infamous laksa (it IS in the name after all, in case anyone is wondering)! With their secret inhouse blend of spices for the laksa soup base, they have elevated the aromatic taste of the dish to new levels of tastiness. For an added twist, customers are encouraged to add the pungent ‘otak udang’ sauce, which is a black paste made from prawn innards to give a special zest to the flavor. Adventurous customers can add some squeezed lime juice and fried onions to the soup, creating a memorable sensation that is hard to forget.
To bolster the delicious laksa, the menu also carries fried chicken meat rolls, more commonly known as the ‘lobak’, which compliments the laksa’s taste. The presence of a meaty dish gives the meal a hearty and filling feel, which may be lacking from just the laksa alone, as the sour-ish soup stimulates the appetite further as you enjoy your meal.

Voiced out to the staff in the kitchen and the manager responded with “it’s cooked in this way, usually. Doesn’t seem to be something wrong.” The staff clearly did not admit this is wrong and they did not try to compensate or offer anything to replace. I would say this is the worst thing that could possibly happen to a F&B company. Quality control - bad. Staff quality - not up to standard and not educated as they did not know what’s the right thing to do they face issues.

Thank you 🙏 - 2 years ago | (1⭐) ALDO a brand with nice shoes collections but unexpectedly I had a very unpleasant shopping experience at Sunway Pyramid outlet on 7th June 2022. I was served by a sales executive (I’ve forgotten his name, a skinny softie Malay guy) I was looking for a pair of sandals, while browsing around, a beautiful and comfy pair catches my eyes.The shopping experience was unfriendly. We are not welcomed by the team at the first stage. Not even a single word or voice from the so called sales executive during attending me. I’m the one who approaching him and asking for the size availability, asking for the ongoing promotions and things lead into the payment stage at the cashier counter. My shopping was less than 10 minutes until the payment stage. It’s just a pair of sandals cost at RM229 (if I’m not mistaken with the accurate price) The guy passed me an iPad without saying anything by putting it on the cashier directly in front of me. When looked into it ,noted that was a CRM customer details membership form and I just fill in the the details. I have doubt with the “password” column. Therefore , I clarify with the staff “excuse me, may I know why & what the password required for? “ It was unexpected that the staff’s attitude was rude instead of explaining to me regarding my concerns, he took the iPad from me directly key in & reconfirm the required password by himself. What an attitude????
Not even saying anything but showing his annoying face and the body signs was so OMG!!!!
It was really a big turn off and ruined my shopping experience! I’ve changed my mind not to proceed the the purchase. I’ll make it short into conclusion, it was unpleasant shopping experience, very rude customer service manners, staffs training not up to the standard in retails & customer service line. I do hope The Management ALDO look serious in this matter as in brand image & future improvements. - 2 years ago | (5⭐) Third time i go here to take a look for a shoe, after that salesgirl named jesselyn, answered my enquires that so much help and cause me to accidentally purchase one of the shoe she suggested. With this knowledge of the salesman i recommended to go here to get a consultant by the salesman which give you so much pleasure to shopping here - 2 years ago | (5⭐) Great service , they offered to bring down my shoe size which was sold out ,  from another branch ! - 8 months ago | (1⭐) I ordered shoes online from aldo the website as a gift for my friend.

This was the birthplace of Arabian Oud. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz Al Jasser founded the store with one mission – to source and expertly blend the best oils and scents in the world. This uncompromising dedication to quality still guides the brand today. Arabian Oud has grown from its origins in the Alzal souk to become the largest Arabian fragrance house in the world. We have taken our oriental perfumes and oils, sourced and blended from the finest ingredients, to international markets, gaining many loyal fans as we have expanded. Today we boast over 900 stores worldwide, and our unique, luxurious perfumes are worn by customers from more than 36 countries worldwide. The most highly-prized ingredient of a perfumer’s palette, oud is said to be the first pure incense found on earth. Derived from dark resin found in the trunk of centuries old Aquilaria trees, this unique perfume has a cultural and religious significance dating back to ancient civilisations. Oud has a deep woody scent that persists and evolves over the whole day. Our team of oud hunters practice unwritten rites handed down from generation to generation. Native to southeast Asia, the rare, resinous heartwood forms in the trunks and roots of trees infected with a parasitic mould. Our oud hunters work tirelessly to source and harvest the finest Agarwood, while respecting the delicate balance of nature to conserve this scarce prize for future generations. Our dedicated team of world renowned perfumers and bottle designers promise perfection in every blend. Using their wealth of experience, they sensitively combine exquisite ingredients in beautiful bottles to showcase the very finest in oriental perfumery. As well as our extensive range of retail perfumes, Arabian Oud has created unique blends for international celebrities and royalty.""",G1.25A (Ground Floor),"(5⭐) Firstly, I’m gate keeping the cologne I got, but it’s damn good 😃

The sales lady will judge you and act like you could not afford their perfume. I buy this perfume brand every other month, normally from mytown and times square, my first time being in this branch, customer service is so bad, makes you feel bad to try spraying.

And the masseuse keep talking with the lady next room, it was not at all relaxing. And the staff at the reception wasn’t friendly. - 8 months ago | (2⭐) Not recommended this place. They didn’t ask at all whether we would like to have male or female massager. Very unprofessional. Not to mention the massaging skill. Overall unsatisfactory - 4 months ago | (5⭐) Was serviced by Lu and my mum by Bong. They were very very polite and professional. We felt so comfortable and they managed to target all the severe spots. Make an early booking for these two masseuse. - 2 years ago | (1⭐) Wouldn’t recommend this place.
I was told by the receptionist lady that there was no masseuse available, so I thought a masseur would do because I had requested a 1 hour head, shoulder, and back massage. I told the lady to tell him to avoid from the sensitive areas like the chest and underarms.
We agreed & proceed with the payment.

However, there are a few things that have severely disappointed me:

1. The masseur asked me to lie face down and begin with leg massage. I was confused and asked him, but his response was brief: ""wait"" till he focused on so much of my hip, at which point I asked if he could start with head and shoulder massage?

2. When we continue with the head and shoulder massage, he tends to “massage” my chest, which makes me feel so uncomfortable that I have to stop him right away.

3. He assumed the massage was 30mins instead of 60 mins until I ask him to double check with the receptionist again.

4. I think they need proper training / professional training, comparable what he has done on the right side, but it was different on the left. Either too much emphasis on the right or only for a short time on the left.

5. Overall experience was really bad due to poor communication. Even if you ask a basic question, either no response or unable to communicate. The massage was ineffective as it did not help on my stiff shoulder and heavy head. - 3 years ago | (4⭐) Good massage after long day walk in Sunway pyramid shopping mall.

The staff service is okay.. maybe can be upgrade.

But when it come to serve us, theres no smile at all until we buy 1 pair of shoe then can hear her voice n a-little bit smile.

The skin on my face is more sensitive and prone to spots than ever. I have started to get breakouts on my chin which I have never done before! My pores are more open I feel which is where the breakouts come from. the forehead also have stubborn breakouts that won’t go even with 2 months on highly rated dermalogica products such as the “age bright serum” which was super expensive yet has done little for my breakouts. Before this acne treatment, my “acne” was hardly noticeable and persistent but after this treatment it is due to my skin being more sensitive. I am extremely disappointed and frustrated. As I am from abroad and was only staying at Malaysia for short-term, I am not able to make a complaint in person or fight to get compensation - so I leave this review to warn other customers. If your skin breakouts aren’t severe and inflammatory, just go for natural treatments. This one was intensive and only made my skin worse. - a year ago | (5⭐) I have been a member of Aster Spring from the time it opened till present and Tracy (Sunway Pyramid branch) has always been very helpful, polite and I just love her facials plus product recommendations.

The piercing was done by a female staff member with glasses. I specifically told her I wanted both ears pierced and repeatedly emphasized that the piercings needed to be at the same height on both sides. She seemed very impatient and assured me that they would be even. She then pierced my ears very quickly, took the payment, and said I could leave immediately.

Now that I’m home, I realize they are indeed uneven, and even people around me can notice the difference.

This was my first time getting my ears pierced, and I didn’t expect it to leave such a disappointing experience. I am very dissatisfied with the results and the customer service attitude of the staff at this branch. I hope the shop owner takes this issue seriously, improves staff training, and ensures more patience in verifying alignment carefully before piercing. - 3 months ago | (5⭐) Great and fast service! It is definitely more pain imo for helix needle piercing in that first injection for awhile. But bearable. I'd done it at Lovisa and it didn't hurt as bad = different type

Price is also quite expensive. So be prepared if you have $$$
RM90 for needle piercing ONE side
Additional RM49 AND ABOVE for titanium earrings selection that are flat back which is great. This one was about RM179 additional for helix

Overall great experience and will come back if I decide to do - a month ago | (5⭐) just wanted to update: 0 bleeding, 0 redness! i totally forgot i pierced them when i got back home.

finally mustered up the courage to get an ear piercing for the first time. if you're looking for somewhere sanitary, sensitive skin, first timers, safe, Attic @ Sunway is a good choice.

i paid a total of rm300+ for needle piercing (much better than a gun) for both sides, upgraded to titanium earrings (rm45 each), cleaning spray & the cream. 100% worth it.

the lady with the headscarf & lots of piercings (i did not get her name sadly), was very kind, explained things, friendly, gave suggestions & was sanitary and quick.

i was in & out within 10 minutes, ears pierced & with everything i needed. - 3 months ago | (5⭐) My go-to piercing place. This is my third time here and yesterday I went to get a double lobe on my right ear. I was pierced by Aisyah and she was so gentle and nice. The whole thing was done in five minutes. I did change to a titanium earrings and that bumps up the price a little bit. Two lobe piercings with titanium earrings cost me RM268. I also did ask Aisyah if I have the anatomy for a rook piercing and thankfully I did. Next time when I got the courage🤞🏼 - 5 months ago | (1⭐) Previously I did my belly piercing at this shop around 2018 which was done by a Chinese lady and it’s still perfectly intact and I didn’t have any reactions nor pain, so I went to the same shop around last year June to do my snake eye piercing, it was a Malay lady who did for me, and she literally pierced my tongue twice!! Cuz she messed up on the first piercing and it was too obvious that it wasn’t parallel, the second time was still wasn’t parallel but not too obvious like the first one😑, I took out the piercing around last year November cuz I was so much in pain and itchiness for the whole time, cuz obviously it wasn’t done properly 😑 it was quite expensive almost around RM200 something but I honestly don’t mind to pay RM200 for a good piercing but it turned out to be otherwise !! I’m never going back to this shop ever again 😑😑 if you’re not well trained then don’t bother doing the job 😑 I feel so mad cuz it was a waste of money and I’m literally traumatised cuz she pierced my tongue twiceeeee😑 and the she has the audacity to tell me that “sengettt sangattt” when she messed it up as tho I did a mistake😑 - 3 weeks ago",Attic Jewelry & Piercing,+60 12-360 1380,"Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Tuesday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Wednesday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Thursday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Friday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Saturday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Sunday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM"

I’d give them four stars for the authentic flavor, with that classic balance of crunch and softness. There was a bit of a wait since it’s popular and plenty of people were ordering, so service wasn’t super quick. The staff handled it well—though they weren’t exactly friendly, they stayed calm and kept things moving smoothly. Prices are fair, so it’s easy to grab a few rolls without spending too much. Worth checking out if you’re around! - 3 months ago | (1⭐) The staff wore the same hand gloves to collect payment (in cash), hand me the mobile phone to collect my phone number, and to my surprise make my popiah too! Oh god! To my dismay, the other staff that I saw wrapping popiah of the customer before me is washing dishes and touching the bin with the SAME PAIR OF GLOVES! I am not surprised if she uses the same pair to prepare food later. This is super unhygienic. No matter how good is the popiah, unfortunately I will not return again until this practice is discontinued. This defeats the purpose of wearing a hand gloves. - 5 months ago | (3⭐) We loved the branch in SS15, so was excited for this one in Sunway pyramid. Sadly it's not as good. It's not crunchy like the one in SS15, most probably cause it's a franchise and they can't do things fresh from the kitchen here. Staff was super slow, was testing my patience 😅 most probably got to drive to ss15 for the best experience for now. Maybe after they figure out quality control for all their franchises, it'll be a lot better - 4 months ago | (2⭐) Quite careless. Ordered shrimp popiah n right in front of me she's making seaweed popiah. There's no one else around so I had to say something for them to recheck and redo. If I didn't say anything that's what I would have gotten. Shrimp popiah uses the tiny shrimps with shells on. Not really my thing. - 2 months ago | (5⭐) Super nice popiah, crunchy keropok combine with flavourful turnip. The sauce is very nice, a combination of spicy and sweet... yums.

from our own secret family recipes. Our name comes from the Malay word “bungkus” (take
away) and the Hokkien word “kaw” (thick).
Just say “bungkus kaw kaw” and you’ll get an authentic, full-bodied Malaysian drink to go,
packed in a plastic bag and secured with a red plastic cord that also serves as a carrier sling.
Quench your thirst with authentic, traditional drinks like Teh Tarik, Kopi or Cham. We aim to
be in every town and city in Malaysia, so everybody can say “Bungkus Kaw Kaw!”
With the influx of foreign coffee franchises, it has become difficult to buy authentic
traditional beverages, especially in shopping malls and offices. Bungkus Kaw Kaw’s mission is
to make these familiar favourites widely available again, made fresh-to-order in the original,
full-flavoured way, at an affordable price. And like all self-respecting mamaks, kopitiams and
warungs, we have our own home-made secret recipes and pride ourselves on pulling no
punches in giving you the strongest, perfect traditional brew.
Our signature drinks, Kopi Kaw Kaw, Teh Tarik Kaw Kaw and Cham Kaw Kaw are made the
good old-fashioned way to ensure the taste of authenticity and traditional. Not only our
lokal drinks are great, we also offer a variety of foods such as Nasi Lemak, Chee Cheong Fun,
Loh Mai Kai, Bihun Siam, Kuih Muih, Roti Bakar, etc. That shape our Malaysian culture today!
Now we are available in Sunway Pyramid, this is a great addition for everyone to enjoy a
lokal authentic drink or food from its taste of Malaysia. To satisfy your lokal cravings, do give
Bungkus Kaw Kaw a try!",LG2.75A (Lower Ground 2 Floor),"(1⭐) My first time breakfast here. Not coming back. Very disappointed. Overrated and overpriced. Food taste nothing special. Quantity below average. A small cup of teh tarik is RM6.70. Basic nasi lemak bungkus daun pisang with only half an egg is RM4.90. Like airline prices.

Not sure what the hype is all about. You can easily get better and cheaper alternatives for breakfast elsewhere nearby. - 2 weeks ago | (3⭐) The taste of the nasi lemak bungkus is no longer what it was. The sambal udang taste was flat. Non-spicy.
The toasted bread had a tiny slice of butter. I would think that they have lost their charm.
Service, too, is dropping. - a year ago | (2⭐) Normal, very normal. Hot Coffee at RM7.80 without the taste of coffee, only sweetness.
But they are conveniently situated in the mall, this is the expensive version of Old Town White Coffee. Nothing special. - a year ago | (5⭐) Delicious Bungkus at Sunway Pyramid!

I recently visited Bungkus Kawkaw at Sunway Pyramid and was thoroughly impressed with my meal. The New Nasi Lemak Rendang was a highlight - the rendang sauce was creamy, spicy, and perfectly balanced, served with a side of fragrant coconut rice.

To quench my thirst, I opted for the Teh Kawkaw, which was a strong and bold black tea that hit the spot.

The ordering process was efficient - simply pay and wait for your food to be prepared. The wait was well worth it, as the food was freshly prepared and packed with flavor.

Overall, I highly recommend Bungkus Kawkaw for a satisfying and delicious meal. Don't miss out on the Nasi Lemak Rendang and Teh Kawkaw - a perfect combination! - 9 months ago | (4⭐) Conveniently located in the mall. Super cheap and simple tasty food.

The service was quite fast from 1 waiter man but quite slow from 1 waiter lady which can clearly saw her attitude I'm not certain if she has a lot of things on her plate but it was quite unprofessional judging her from her body posture.

I had one of the worst dining experiences at this restaurant. Despite six empty tables, we had to wait 30 minutes just for the staff to clean one so we could sit. The place is clearly understaffed, crammed and the existing employees work extremely slowly—taking orders, serving food, and even handling payments not within stipulated time-frame which leads for congestion and long queue.

Most frustrating and disappointing scenarios is thier very own employee is serving the customers without break time and most of the suffering with empty stomach for accomplishing duty.

The lack of crowd management and efficiency is frustrating, especially for hungry customers waiting for food. If you value your time and good service, this is not the place to visit. Definitely not worth the wait! - a week ago | (4⭐) Would have given 5 star if not for that poor service. Waited for some time for a table even though there were empty ones but not cleared. One staff had the audacity to ask to move from a bigger table (cleared) to a smaller table (dirty and full of uncleared dishes). She should have the courtesy to clear the smaller table before asking anyone to change table.

Anyway, food was good and portion was generous. Will definitely come back with more people so that I can order more side dishes. - 3 months ago | (1⭐) Shortage of staff working when we arrive around6pm during weekend. Table not full but they close to receive customers saying they can’t afford full house customers. Return to try after 1hr then only they open their door. Food serve weren’t hygiene.

Even though they mentioned vegetables  are refillable but only managed to eat one round then no more add on because not enough vege..seriously gonna wait for more than half an hour for refill.. yea no fried veggies to refill even though they said is refillable.

Founded in 1945 in Glendale, California, Baskin-Robbins has grown to become one of the world’s largest chain of ice cream specialty shops while keeping true to its neighborhood ice cream parlor values. Baskin-Robbins was co-founded by brothers-in-law and ice cream enthusiasts Irvine “Irv” Robbins and Burton “Burt” Baskin. Robbins worked in his father’s ice cream shops as a teen, while Baskin produced ice cream for his fellow U.S. Navy troops while serving in World War II. Upon Burt’s return from war, the entrepreneurs made their vision of creating a family-friendly ice cream shop a reality.
In its early days, Baskin-Robbins 31® began with a selection of 31 flavors – a different one for each day of the month. Today, Baskin-Robbins’ menu has grown to over a thousand delightful ice cream flavors and an ever expanding assortment of delicious treats – often creating new delicacies to fit local tastes as well! From blended drinks, ice cream, frozen yoghurt, ice cream cakes, sundaes and even to milkshakes, Baskin-Robbins is sure to have something for everyone!

Business was especially brisk during festive seasons for this high-quality traditional delicacy, which Mr Teo Swee Ee introduced as ‘bakkwa’. Through his passion for calligraphy and divination, he created the Bee Cheng Hiang brand name, 美珍香. Each character is composed with nine calligraphic strokes, signifying brand longevity and a representation of the Bee Cheng Hiang experience. Today, the brand has spread across many parts of the world, including our very own Sunway Pyramid!
Visitors to their shops are treated to the sight, smell and taste of our products. Unchanged since 1933, their recipe retains the traditional taste, and is uncompromising in quality. Each bakkwa are still hand crafted, over traditional bamboo sieves. That’s why no two pieces are the same. The meat is smoked for hours over the slow burning flames of charcoal.
Bee Cheng Hiang is more than just a ‘bakkwa’ company. Their Vision is to be Asia’s leading food company: providing quality products and services to the global market. In a world where food safety is of utmost importance, customers can enjoy their products with a peace of mind. Each bakkwa are made with 100% natural ingredients, without added meat tenderizer, preservatives, artificial flavouring or colouring and MSG.
This has remained true since their inception in 1933 and remains true today.

Having been in the industry for more than 20 years, Borneo Pearls has made its mark in the industry by offering high quality jewellery that is carefully handcrafted by trained artisans. These exquisite pieces come in various sizes, colours and styles to choose from - there's a pearl for every girl! They offer both freshwater and seawater pearls in the form of necklaces, rings, bracelets and earrings. Interesting fact about their products, freshwater pearls are formed in mussels, whereas saltwater pearls are formed in oysters! These exclusive pearls from Borneo will enhance any outfit whether it’s with their classic or contemporary design.
They even offer Golden South Sea pearls, originating from the largest pearl-producing oyster, hence generally larger than most saltwater pearl varieties and take a longer time grow, estimated to grow between 2-4 years. So how are these prized South Sea beauties valued? It typically depends mostly on the colour of the pearl! Rare and highly desired, they range from beautiful shades of creamy white to deep gold, with shades of yellow and champagne falling in between. Pearls that have a deeper golden colour are considered more valuable, such as how the deepest golden colour, being referred to as 24 karat, is said to be the most valuable colour for South Sea pearls. However, these pearls may not be perfectly spherical as they have very thick nacre. When pearls are harvested, there is usually a large amount of drop pearls, baroque pearls, circle pearls and button pearls.

I am writing to express my disappointment with the service that I received from one of your sales representatives, Niam, during my recent visit to your store located at [Braun Buffel Sunway Pyramid 3, Jalan PJS 11/15, Bandar Sunway, 46150 Petaling Jaya, Selangor ] on 6th May 2023 at 6:40 PM.

I approached Niam to inquire about waxing my old wallet and purchasing a new one. However, instead of addressing my concerns, Niam seemed disinterested and ignored me. Despite my repeated attempts to engage him in conversation, he simply walked away, leaving me feeling frustrated and ignored.

As a customer, I expect to receive courteous and professional service, especially when I am interested in purchasing your products. Unfortunately, Niam's behavior fell well below these basic expectations and left me with a negative impression of your store. I had planned to purchase a new wallet and have my old one waxed, but due to the poor service I received. - a year ago",Braun Büffel Sunway Pyramid,+60 3-5613 3172,"Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Tuesday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Wednesday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Thursday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Friday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Saturday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Sunday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM"

And they do so because Burger King restaurants are known for serving high-quality, great tasting, and affordable food. Founded in 1954, BURGER KING® is the second largest fast food hamburger chain in the world.
BURGER KING commenced its earliest operations in Malaysia in 1997 with the opening of its first restaurant at the Sungai Buloh Overhead Bridge. Today, Cosmo Restaurants Sdn Bhd operates more than 50 BURGER KING restaurants all across Malaysia, where customers across the country can enjoy the great and healthy flame-grilled taste of Burger King products. Beyond just burgers, Burger King's menu has expanded from a basic offering of burgers, French fries, sodas, and milkshakes to a larger and more diverse set of products. In 1957, the ""Whopper"" became the first major addition to the menu, and it has become Burger King's signature product since. Burger King has also tailored its menu for regional tastes. With a local twist of variations to their burgers and menu, Burger King has introduced many interesting menus such as the infamous limited edition Nasi Lemak Burger and Satay Burgers, as well as the Nasi King combo to cater to their Asian customers. Even their drinks and side orders are varied from time to time, especially during festive periods such as Raya!
The original HOME OF THE WHOPPER, their commitment to premium ingredients, signature recipes, and family-friendly dining experiences is what has defined Burger King for over 50 successful years.

I have reached out to the shop to request an exchange or refund, but they have completely ignored me. This experience has been incredibly disappointing. Selling defective items while claiming they’re in perfect condition, especially for CNY, shows a lack of professionalism and care for customers.

DO NOT RECOMMEND TO BUY FROM THEM !!!! - a month ago | (1⭐) Wanted to try the outfit in blue but staff don’t allow. Only can try the size I want in pink. How do I know if I look good in blue or not if I’m not allowed to try ? First time encounter such clothing store that doesn’t allow customer to try on other colour. Wanted to buy it and really like the design but decided to not buy cause staff rude and don’t allow to try. 😅 - a month ago | (1⭐) I understand that customers have to queue to enter the store as it is quite small. However, we ended up waiting for a very long time (over 30 minutes). The ladies in front of us had already gone in, shopped, and left, yet we were still stuck outside like 🤡. The staff wouldn’t let us in, even though there were very few customers inside, while the queue outside kept growing.
What a terrible queue management. Also a lady casually walked in, supposedly to ask about her daughter’s clothes, but ended up browsing for herself ☺️, knowing that she’s cut the queue but still act dumb (or maybe she’s just dumb ☺️). The staff saw it happen and just acted like nothing was wrong 🤷🏻‍♀️. I would never enter this shop again 🙂 - a month ago | (1⭐) Although the clothes are nice, the staff's attitude is extremely negative. During Chinese New Year, they exhibit a type of expression that implies they have no money to buy their clothes like that. And I also saw a lot of negative reviews about the staff. If the shop's attitude remains unchanged, I will make a complaint to Sunway Pyramid Management. - 3 weeks ago | (1⭐) If I could give zero stars, I would. The service was absolutely terrible. The queue was incredibly long, and when we asked if we could go in—especially since most of the customers inside had already left—the staff told us to wait. To make matters worse, a customer blatantly cut the queue and went in, and the staff didn’t even bother to address it. This level of service is unacceptable - a month ago",Chic Studio,N/A,N/A

Quoting what that gentleman says ""upgrading a lps for a DC in product makes no sense, as it's not 240V AC in type"" you can't compare.

You are feeling a bit lost here? No worries, I believe he has no idea what he is talking about, they even bash their own product and having the mindset of expensive stuff must always be better. I believe a salesman who works in Hi-end HiFi shop should have the basic knowledge, having someone shytting on the brand they carry just because it's cheaper, and the fact that he doesn't appreciate the difference a good power supply can do in a system even for a DC in product, I don't think that guy is qualified for the job.

Furthermore, the guy is being very impatient and kinda rude, you will get a feeling of they don't want to serve you if you don't bring a stack of cash and put it on the counter to show them you are a serious buyer. Definitely would not buy from such guy even if I like the system.

As someone who has bought from other CMY branch, I feel disappointed with such service was provided.

There are more to add, when I try to test him out if he knows what he is selling. the product definitely said ""analog volume"", which switches between relays for the volumes control. When I bring up this topic, he is very sure that it's a false claim from the manufacturer, he claims that all manufacturers claim so, but it's a chip base digital gain volume control. So I would appreciate that if the salesman learn more about the product they are selling, if you are unsure, don't act like you know all of them.

However, during weekday's after office hour, the gym would be super crowded.... even on weekends, this outlet is more crowded than other branches, probably due to its location in a shopping mall..

Sesame Chicken Claypot ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Suancai Fish ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Long review:
In my 4th visit, I decided not to go for those chicken hotpot options and settled for a sesame chicken claypot and suancai fish. Yes, even Chicken Claypot House cannot deny the popularity of this dish now in Malaysia and has introduced it into their menu as a seasonal offer.
Sesame Chicken Claypot ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
I thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The sauce was really savory with just enough of that sesame taste. In addition to that, the finely chopped and pre-fried ginger gave this dish that extra fragrant taste. So it was not good for my dieting plan as I ended up having two and a half bowl of rice just because of it. The chicken was also pre-marinated I believe. It was flavorful although the kitchen staff gave me mostly chicken breast.

One criticism I have for this restaurant is its rice. It's very lumpy and has limited the joy of having this sauce on the rice. 1 star for the rice.

Suancai Fish ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
For this dish, it came in a humongous bowl. There's not a lot of fish slices but the quality of the fish is there. No earthy taste unlike Tai Er. For me, that is my number one criteria when it comes to eating fish. To be fair to Tai Er, the first and the last time I was there was about one and half years ago. I hope things have changed now for them. Coming back to Chicken Claypot House's version, the peppercorn soup gives you quite the heat after consuming it for a while. But it was good and I like the fact that the sourish taste did not go overboard as to render it acidic in taste. Another important thing to note is that it did not come with a THICK layer of oil unlike the others that I have tried before. So I did not have to spend time filtering away the oil. So it does hold up well to other restaurants that specialize in this dish. - 3 months ago | (4⭐) Soups are super tasty and big bowl .love the fish soup portion reasonable come with 龟苓膏 and herbal tea. Recommended. - 3 weeks ago | (4⭐) 1. Signature claypot chicken: It was delicious and paired well with rice. The chicken was flavorful.

2. Herbal chicken soup: Just okay. The herbal taste wasn't particularly strong, with limited chicken pieces.

3. Fish head steamboat: A new addition to the menu. The dish had a decent taste.

Generally, the food here had a heavy flavor and left us feeling quite thirsty after the meal. It was enjoyable, but we would recommend having a beverage on hand to counterbalance the strong taste. - a year ago | (3⭐) Indoor aircond environment, not to worry having steamboat even under warm weather. This eatery has few branches and their have several main dishes / pot soup to choose from, then you can add other ingredients.

Taste ok, nothing much to shout about. Definately not a cheap choice - 2 years ago | (3⭐) First time there and I have to say it wasn't a happy experience. RM78 chicken herbal soup for two is steep. You have to pay rm2 for Condiments. We added on tongho vegy and just a small handful costed rm8.90. the pricing and portions didn't make any sense.

Worked out to over rm60/pax with just veg and tofu added, 2 small rice and one glass of Chinese tea. I can't say I have much to say about the service either. - 11 months ago",鸡煲之家 Chicken Claypot House (Sunway Pyramid),+60 16-251 9886,"Monday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Tuesday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Wednesday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Thursday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Friday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Saturday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Sunday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM"

Its financial success led to the subsequent opening of a kiosk in Mytown Shopping Centre, Cheras in 2017 which proved to be an even bigger success.

We ordered their mushroom jack fajitas & monterey chicken. Both came piping hot. The highlight has to be the fajitas. My favorite at Chili's. From the juicy chicken & beef slices to the flavorful mushrooms topped with all the gooey cheese. Great on its own but better with the tortilla wrap. Sadly they don't give guacamole anymore unless added as a side. The monterey chicken was also good. Juicy & flavorful. Both were very filling. We were stuffed for the whole day.

I recently visited this restaurant after being drawn in by a 50% discount promotion. Unfortunately, the experience left me feeling underwhelmed and questioning the value for money. Here’s a breakdown of my visit:

Atmosphere ★★★★☆ (4/5)
The restaurant has a cozy and inviting vibe with wooden tables and tasteful decorations. Since it’s located inside a mall, the air conditioning keeps the space comfortable, making it a pleasant spot to sit and relax. However, the ambiance didn’t quite make up for the other shortcomings.

Service ★★★☆☆ (3/5)
The ordering process is straightforward—you place your order at the counter, and the staff delivers it to your table. While the staff was polite, it took about 10 minutes for our food to arrive, which is reasonable but not particularly fast. The service was average, with no standout moments of hospitality.

Food ★★☆☆☆ (2/5)
The food was disappointing overall. The portions were noticeably smaller than advertised, and the quality didn’t justify the price.
•	Chicken Katsu Cromburger ★★☆☆☆ (2/5):
The burger looked promising at first glance, with fresh and soft bread. However, the chicken was tough and difficult to chew, which ruined the dish. I added scrambled eggs and vegetables for an extra RM8, but they were bland and didn’t add much flavor.
•	Chicken Pepperoni Croissant ★★★☆☆ (3/5):
This dish fared slightly better than the cromburger. The croissant was flaky and buttery, but the chicken pepperoni filling lacked seasoning and excitement. It was edible but not memorable.
The overall taste of the dishes felt uninspired, with no standout flavors or attention to detail in preparation.

Price ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5)
This is where things went downhill fast. The 50% discount promotion was misleading—it only applied if you ordered an overpriced drink. I ended up ordering a Bloody Mocha with Cheese for nearly RM17, which was overly sweet and gimmicky. With additional charges like RM8 for scrambled eggs, my total bill for two people came to almost RM78 after taxes. For this price, I expected much higher quality food and larger portions.

Parking - N/A
Since this restaurant is located inside a mall, parking depends entirely on the mall’s facilities. It wasn’t an issue during my visit, but this will vary based on location and time of day.

Final Verdict: Not Worth Revisiting
With its tricky marketing tactics, overpriced menu items, and below-average food quality, I won’t be returning to this restaurant anytime soon. While the atmosphere was pleasant enough, it doesn’t make up for the lackluster dining experience or poor value for money. If you’re looking for better options in this price range, there are plenty of other restaurants that offer superior quality at a fairer price.
Ideal Times to Visit: If you’re still curious about trying this place despite its flaws, visiting during off-peak hours might ensure faster service and a quieter atmosphere.

The cinnabun taste as good as before when the open in NU sentral and i have bought many times from there when i passed by however when i tried once from sunway pyramid ,the cinnabon taste is completely different , it does not taste like previous, the bun is very hard and dry, just like some cinamon bread i can get from any bakery shop. afterwards, I give another chance to get from Nu sentral again and thought its was the outlet issues , unfortunately the taste is just worse like sunway pyramid.

Cinnabon isn’t cheap and quite pricy for many people, so when we get this type of low quality food will double the disappointment… hope the owner can have a quality control and dont use cheap flour just to earn more money! - a month ago | (4⭐) Biscoff mini cinnamon was good .

The sales staff intentionally avoid eye contact and when I approach them they just walk away/pretend didn't notice. - 2 months ago | (4⭐) Staff experience in watches is exceptionally excellent particularly at One Utama and Subang Parade outlets. Environment is OK but can be upgraded to marque level. Prices is reasonable. However, the Internet information especially on the telephone numbers are not up to date.

The brand became synonymous with its famous Desert Boots, a pair of distinctive ankle-high boots made from calf suede leather, with a crepe rubber sole. Catering to both the needs and desire of men and women, their footwear comes in vast range of styles and collections. Men and women who seek comfortable footwear that makes them look sophisticated and classy should stop by Clarks and try on these different collections: Clarks Originals, boots, sandals, shoes, CloudSteppers, trigenic and unstructured. Or if you’re more inclined to a specific design, you can always opt to shop based on the various styles they offer.
For the men, if you’re looking for something that’s easy to wear, try on their range of slips ons. Need something that you can move around quickly in? Check out their practical yet still fashionable pairs of sneakers. Loafers, lace ups, casual and smart styles are also available to cater to everyone’s preference.
Women can either don on a pair of heels or wedges to add on extra height while looking effortlessly chic. If you’re required to walk around for hours and don’t think heels are the most practical option, not to worry, Clarks has got you covered with their flats, loafers, slips on, lace up, sneakers, smart and casual styles as well.
Now Lion has an idea for those of you shopping at Clarks, why not both you and your significant other get a matching style or collection? It’ll look super cute and what better way to experiment with fashion together!

The male staff member who assisted us was extremely slow and appeared disinterested, as though he was fasting. He informed us that all shoes on the rack were 31% off, while new arrivals were not on sale. However, as we were about to make our purchase, another staff member told us that the prices on the shoes were fixed, and the discount was only 15% if we signed up for a membership. This significant discrepancy in pricing led us to leave without questioning them further. To add to our frustration, when I mentioned our expectation of a 31% discount, a female staff member wearing a tudung rolled her eyes and began discussing us as we exited the store. We were deeply disappointed by the lack of proper customer service and hospitality at Clark's. Horrible customer service and misleading price offered to customers. - 6 months ago | (1⭐) 2 days ago I went to Clarks Pyramid. just ask if there is a warranty on the purchase of shoes only.

The Quartet S is similar to the previous one but with adds Ethiopian beans creating a fresh, fruity taste and exquisite aroma. Opening at Sunway Pyramid has allowed them to share their coffee expertise and artistry for everyone to enjoy.",LG1.106 (Lower Ground 1 Floor),"(4⭐) I was there on a friday, from early when they opened until around 11am, and the vibes were pretty nice, the dark, wooden aesthetics are nice, and it was quiet and chill.

I got a pain au chocolat and a caramel latte for 9.50 and 16.00 respectively, totalling to 27.05 after tax, which is a little steep of a pricing to be honest, but its just a little more expensive than usual cafe prices nowadays, so its still acceptable.

the pain au chocolat was average, nothing extraordinary, it had nice layers and a fair amount of chocolate inside, but for the price, I personally wouldn’t get it again, but it’s not bad.
the caramel latte was actually quite enjoyable, it fit my tastes well, it’s somewhat sweet with good caramel flavour, but not overwhelmingly sweet, and the coffee flavour was present but more mellow than others i’d say, which is still quite nice. and their ice is really crunchy👍🧊

service was standard too, order and pay at counter, get a beeper thing, take a seat and wait until it beeps to go get your order.

overall not bad, would be back again to try different things.

On 2nd of February 2019, at 8:58 I had a nasty encounter with 3 cashiers with foul attitudes towards me wanting to swap my change for a better note (the one they gave me had a significantly big hole on it) as not all stores accept torn notes. The male cashier (MUHD SYAFIQ) pretended to exchange the note but instead gave me the same one with a hole (he covered it with his fingers). The other male (AHMAD AMNAN) who was in charge of handling my purchase completely ignored my request to change notes and walked off. Not only are the staff ignorant and dishonest, a female salesperson/cashier (idrk) mocked at my request to change notes. She even made the comment saying ""It is still accepted"" and continued to make rude comments on me to her co-workers.

Was changing the dress halfway. The owner did not ask for my consent not inform me anything and just barged in and looked at me wearing the dress halfway. She asked ok or not after that and thought Ididnt know how to wear the dress correctly as ifs upside down/flippers over. I said ok then I said I can do it I'm wearing now. Then she left but the curtain was left opened about half.

Complaints:
Did not ask for my permission/consent before coming in.
Did not inform me verbally before coming in.
Did not have my INFORMED CONSENT before coming in.
Invasion of privacy (doesn't matter if they have their clothes on or not)
The cctv was angled outside the fitting room. This incident was RECORDED and there is a solid evidence. If there's none from the footage, I believe you have probably deleted it. But I have witnesses as well.

I've read your reviews and turns out I'm not the only victim that encounter this. You either apologize or might as well shut down the store. With that kind of behavior I don't think anyone would even come and help/support with your business.

I felt to traumatized and speechless during that incident because it was very random and unexpected and I was not even informed. I was so close to burst out in tears full of fear but I managed to handle it well.

So what if you're a female? Does that give you any rights for you to just barged in like that without my consent? You're not even my family member nor friends what gives you the right to treat your customers like that? Did no one teach you how to respect others privacy?

Please fix your behavior. I will not report you to the police but I will make sure others know about your behavior. Either you fix it now or you can start to prepare yourself in court.

Service at mid valley or lalaport is good . However, This is the first time I went to pyramid branch and the service was terrible. There is a very rude , wearing spec skinny aunty. Her face is like owning her some million dollar and asked her opinion. She is not patient to answer my question.The string prior adjust , she asked me is it to fix at this point. However, it ended up wearing tightly . I asked her to readjust it but she reluctant and mentioned that it is normal and was told that it will loosen after wearing many times . She mentioned that if is consider tight, my hand will have mark. I asked to readjust for 3 times and more she still reluctant and she did not provide me the extra crystal , until I asked it. At the end of day, I wore it for a day and there is really mark on my hand.
I will not visit this branch anymore. Dear management , please ensure a good customer service at this branch. Mid valley or Lala port branch will advise me whether which length fits me. - 9 months ago | (1⭐) What a disappointment !
I'm a regular customer of Lucky Gems but, the branch I usually went to is Sunway Velocity and Midvalley. Since I shopping in the mall I decided to went inside for a stringing service.

What a rude long hair, wearing spectacle, skinny aunty ! What do you meant you cannot help to string ? What do you meant you scare the beads will gone or get stolen because too busy with customer ? Hello ! Please use your common sense, I'm sitting at the counter there and you are in front of me. You dare to say, you need to serve customer when half-way stringing my bracelet ?

I already come inside sit there patiently waiting you to finish serve the customer before me,  but when another customer come in you straight ran to her. Hello please, is stringing not worth your time and commission ? Please don't work in this service industry if you have such judging character aunty.

Management please educate your staff before allowing them to serve customer and take our customer complaints seriously. - a year ago | (1⭐) I was extremely disappointed with the staff working here, she was really rude towards me. I wanted to buy a birthstone for my mother in law, and when I asked her if they sold birthstones here, she raised her voice and never gave me a yes or no answer. I thought I could get advice about the birthstones and how they would be set as well as their charges, but this particular staff who was an older female was very crude in her answers. She should not be working there, I hope the management does something about this. As a customer looking to buy something pricey,I would expect better treatment at the very least. I walked out without even having a look at their selections just because of her rude behaviour. Utterly disappointing! - a year ago | (2⭐) Bought a rose quartz bracelet from here. Quality varies so choose properly. I asked if the piece I picked is with a discount and the female staff who attended to me calculated the price like as if I’m buying gold! Not once but 3 times to assure me she’s giving me the best deal, it was so funny I played along! I’m not sure if the final price is fixed or I’ve been cheated but it was within my budget for a gift, so I took it. - 2 years ago | (1⭐) I have been a very regular customer of them and on single purchase I spend almost 4-5k but i was away from country for 1 year and once i got back i wanted something specific and since i was staying in my in law house this time in Seremban i didnt want to travel so far away so i called up the shop asking to send 1 pic only of the item the staff was saying the line connection in shop is bad and annoying part is the staff even didnt bother to use their own mobile to send the picture.

Then when we wanted order some desserts we chose, the worker said there wasn’t any stock for the taro. Then after we decided on another dessert to order, he again told us there is no stock again. So frustrating. He could have just told us before us choosing that there are some items that aren’t available.

overall the food was okay. A bit pricey for the boba taufufa. such a small bowl for like the price of Rm 20.

For the snowflake strawberry yogurt, it was too high and when you eat it, it will just drop on the tray. So just keep in mind it’s very high risk in wastage. - 5 months ago | (1⭐) Not worth it!!! Not worth the price!!!

But during my recent visit in May 2024, it started to see some local staff working there, especially as Cashier. This store is popular among young people, student, foreigner & tourist, especially female. Even though, the Japanese Yen had been down to the Forex rate of 3.0 but the price is never down but keep on increasing.

So I give an extra star of this review.

However, today (Oct 6) when I was about to check out, a local cashier was chit chatting with her colleague and didn't provide me with any basic payment info's properly. When I requested to scan my Sunway Pals, she impatiently told me I should have mentioned it earlier and processed it without saying thank you. Shouldn't it be her responsibility to ask the customer beforehand, rather than the customer having to make the request?

Staff were friendly and attentive. - 2 weeks ago | (4⭐) We ordered 3 main dishes and 4 drinks. The quality, presentation and portion of the food is pretty good.

Our mix platter were generally okay. My son love the yogurt sauce and I think he complimented it at least 10 times. Lol. The lamb meat is a little on the tough, chewier side. The kebab is also a little dense. Chicken breast cutlets a little overcooked. Hummus needs more olive oil & I would prefer if you don't spread it so thinly on the plate. By the time it is served it almost dried out. Probably just spread on certain portion of the plate and keep it thicker.

The beef burger (served using a pita bread) is good. My only comment is the sauce used in it taste a little like cheap cheese sauce. Otherwise, the nachos, salad are good. The meat inside is flavorful but still also on the dense side. I think maybe is the same meat mixture as the kebab.

The buffalo wings batter is really crispy. The fries are done so well. Super crispy and well seasoned.

The drinks were all great in taste and presentation.

We love the atmosphere and the service attitude. ♥️ - 2 months ago | (4⭐) First time had our dinner to celebrate new year eve. The food was well presented, tasted good & value for money. Service was fast & reliable. Loved to see their see thru transparent kitchen concept where you can view the chef in action.

Seemed to have just the dough, cheese, green pepper, tomato and beef strips. Didn't taste any base sauce. The milkshake with mangos, grapes and mint with something red like raisins had more ice than vanilla ice cream. Wasn't sure whether it was ice blended or milkshake though it said it's supposed to be made with vanilla ice cream. Still might go back to taste the other food hoping my order wasn't their specialty. - 2 weeks ago | (4⭐) Good menu variety, very unique fusion of modern mediterranean food. Place is comfortable and bright, and service is good. Loved the nachos and especially that dipping sauce that came with it.
Ordered the falafel wrap because it seemed pretty unique. Taste was great but somehow it didn't sit well with my stomach later on.
We got the free baklava set from signing up and honestly it was not too sweet and just nice.

To find it you need to enter via the Sunway Lagoon side of the Sunway Pyramid Mall and then head to a little alley at the side of the Jollibee restaurant. Walk approximately 10-15 metres and then where you'll see the restaurant on your right.

Now the decor and atmosphere of the restaurant is a close replica of a typical Middle Eastern cafe in the movies unless you have actually travelled there.

The waiting staff is courteous and accommodating.  Furthermore the staff that waited on us was pretty proficient in Mandarin and Hokkien which was a delightful surprise to me and my friend.

Now for the food... What can I say. It was really yummy with the lamb stewed to falling of the bone and the chicken was fork tender. The mix platter kebabs was scrumptious as well with just a minor misharmony with the chicken kebab being a tad dry in this symphony of good food vibes.

The pricing for the food is quite reasonable with each pax coming to approx RM30-40.

Only 1 person/counter that could give numbers on a Saturday noon and the queue is super long. The same counter spends a lot of time answering queries to customers while there are dedicated counters for it. I see a lot of unhappy customers. Another man questioned them. But their response was yea, just 1 counter. Could do better. - a month ago | (1⭐) I don’t understand the hospitality of the staff here. I was sitting on one of the chairs while waiting for my number to be called. Then this one staff just turned out from nowhere and asked me to move to other spot because she needed to call out another customer’s ticket number. There were so many empty spots. Instead of asking your customer to move, why didnt the staff move instead? Other than that, I was requesting to transfer to other provider. The staff who served me did not even try to persuade me to continue using their services. I found out that there were competitive packages offered by browsing through a file on the side, but not even one word from the staff l. I guess the file is only for decoration purpose. Great way to keep business up by losing customer. - a year ago | (1⭐) Horrible and ridiculous ticketing system with no info provided. The staff with tablet gave a ticket number but only 1 counter was in service, it takes 15mins for 1 number to be called. In fact, there are several other staff at no-number counters that moved through customers more quickly than the ones who got the ticket number.

1. No QMS machine but to take Queue no from 1 and the only staff standing there and without indicating that, ""pls take queue no from me"". Ended up, I'm roaming around to fine the ticketing machine.
2. When explained to the staff, asked to wait lo. Then I said cannot be ma.. since 10/12 no update at all
3. There are 11 ppl ahead from me, 30 mins past, still waiting mode 🙄
4. No proper sitting area for those waiting customers
5. They don't keen on my enquiry that I placed order online but still not yet receive my item. The queue no lady even asked me to just wait lah... 😒 but waited for more than 3 working days from klang valley delivery only.
Just waste of time here. - 2 months ago | (1⭐) Went here today to fix my name, it was captured wrongly when I self register in the Digi app when I purchase the number. It's my second number. There's one Chinese lady I'm not sure her name she was at counter 5. She told me it cant be done since I got outstanding amount, I have to clear everything. I just want to fix my name that's all. She make faces and look at me up and down. So so bad!!! I wasn't satisfied then I came again and met with one Indian guy at counter 6. He was very helpful!!! The reason I came again is because I have been waiting for an hour to get number with my 2 starving kids!!!! - 3 weeks ago | (1⭐) I've been waiting for an hour (update I waited for almost 2 hours to be seen). I came on a weekend before.. It was horrible and now I am here on a weekday and it is WORSE. EXPAND. You have this ONE store that can handle special contracts. The company expanded to celcome so it HAS to expand its customer service. Wasting everyone's time here. The line is out of the store into the walk way.

Overall I waited and was there for 2+ hours. - 3 months ago | (1⭐) Terrible customer service experience

There were 2 sales assistants and both were serving their customer respectively. Understand that they have to complete the request of current customer before move to next to customer. However, I was standing there 5 minutes ++ and none of them took any actions to inform or let me know how long I would need to wait. - 4 months ago | (1⭐) me and my husband came to the store wanted to ask a question from them but nobody serve us. we did asking for help from the two chinese worker but they say to wait for a minute, while one of them did serve a chinese customer before us. i think it’s a bit racist, cause we waited and waited. even maxis have a lot of customer they can serve us so much better than you guys. please improve your customer service, thank you - 4 months ago",Digi Store Express Sunway Pyramid,N/A,"Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Tuesday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Wednesday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Thursday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Friday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Saturday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Sunday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM"

First time tried the crab meat xiaolongbao, it was ok, personally still prefer the pork xiaolongbao. The mushroom vegetables fried rice was surprisingly good.

Service: the waiting time is very long. We were being told the waiting time is only 30 minutes but we ended up waited for an hour. Not recommended if you are in a hurry. The service was just at an average level which personally found it to be under my expectations.

Atmosphere: it was conducive to have meal. - 2 weeks ago | (5⭐) Vegetarian friendly for certain menu
Their number queue system is effective, once you got the number please wait outside your number will be called soon.
You may fill up your order form while queueing then once u got the table just pass the order form to them.
Food serve fast and hot.
Their vegetarian fried rice is delicious. - 2 months ago | (5⭐) Loved how quick and efficient the service is at this outlet. There was a short queue but me and my friend were able to get seated within 5 minutes. The food was also served fairly quickly.
Pork chop fried rice is good, the 小笼包 as well. But the main highlight was the 辣子鱼片 that was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and cooked to absolute perfection.
Definitely the best DTF outlet here! - 6 months ago | (4⭐) Food was great except the chilli fried fish which tasted like nuggets. Service needs to be improved, no one knows what to do after serving or proper way talking to customers. Too many new staffs I guess... - 3 weeks ago | (5⭐) Xiao long Pao is the best.
Beef soup is also very good.

The vege bun is not good though, it is very dry and tasteless.
However, I have been here a few times ordering different dishes. The takeaway is that they are very refined and premium, also worth the price.

I like that they provide toothpick that is effective, and they provide tissue paper, not the wet wipes that cost you money. - 4 months ago",Din Tai Fung 鼎泰豐 at Sunway Pyramid,+60 3-5611 2236,"Monday: 10:30 AM – 9:30 PM, Tuesday: 10:30 AM – 9:30 PM, Wednesday: 10:30 AM – 9:30 PM, Thursday: 10:30 AM – 9:30 PM, Friday: 10:30 AM – 9:30 PM, Saturday: 10:00 AM – 9:30 PM, Sunday: 10:00 AM – 9:30 PM"

#BeautyTreats",G1.137 (Ground Floor),"(1⭐) I went to this store today with my mom. Maybe it's because we dressed casually, but when we entered, I tried some perfume samples and decided to buy a new one, as I had used it before. Unfortunately, an auntie SA suddenly approached us, briefly promoted the product, and then just left us there. My mom noticed that her expression seemed to suggest she thought we couldn't afford the price, and as a result, she didn't want to serve us . Immediately, my mom took me to another brand, where the SA was much more professional. Please make sure to properly train your sales associates. Cuz same price customer can get different service - a month ago | (2⭐) The concerns raised in other reviews about the service are valid—don’t expect exceptional treatment, especially from the older staff.

When I walked in and asked for input on specific product, I needed some opinions on what to get, an older staff simply pointed me to a section without offering any real help and quickly moved on to attend to someone else while also showing a strong attitude.

Only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because there's a chinese guy that is much friendlier and attentive compared to the rest. If he wasn't there, I wouldn't recommend anyone to go if service matters to you. - 2 months ago | (1⭐) I visited the Dior store in Sunway Pyramid on 24/12/2024, the female staff had single eyelids, tall figure, I don't remember her name, she advised me and showed contempt for me, I bought a product of Sauvage men's perfume 100ml, and with such contempt for customers, I will never return to the Dior store again. - a month ago | (3⭐) Previously i used to buy my makeup at Dior Sunway Pyramid.

I'm writing now because another person said something about an old woman who works there. So here's what happened. This old lady that worked there was extremely rude and basically said that there's no shade for my skin tone in their shop in a condescending manner when I entered the store. Mind you, I'm Indian. She was constantly making comments on my skin texture by comparing it to my sister's. It made me feel very insecure.  She was also hesitant to help out. No smile or polite gestures. I left without buying anything because I was so upset. A couple of weeks later I passed by dior again. The same woman was very smiley and inviting to a few Chinese girls who were walking across to enter the branch. Feels very racist. The management should do something about this.

Please think twice before getting pierced here. - 2 years ago | (1⭐) Not recommended if you want to do your piercing here. So unprofessional.

Posts that says dirty or food poisoning, mostly is 99% true. Went and had dinner, had few bites of the tofu stew, and then i saw the squid ring.

First time in my life i see squid ring has this “texture”. I tried to scrap off with my finger and it came off easily. Made a complain to cancel the food and asked what was it. The staff came back later and say because its frozen squid ring, after cooked, the skin becomes like this cause of the bubbles. Really? Like really im supposed to believe that? Or is it a fly laid eggs on it thats why it has those white things? Don’t say they are sesame seed also because they are smaller than that. I’ve asked a chef that has been dealing with frozen squid rings for years, he mentioned he never seen such thing before.

Third photo is an example of fly eggs (zoomed in) that was sent by my friend that works in pest control company. Not sure if its the same thing found on the squid, but better be safe than sorry.

Last visit for Dubuyo outlets. - 3 months ago | (4⭐) Great food options with affordable prices and set menus available too.

Got the honey garlic chicken lunch set. Portion is worth the price.
But while the food was still tasty, the chicken did not actually taste like honey garlic. Food presentation for this dish could be improved. The iced barley tea was also extremely watered down. Tasted like nothing but ice water.

Would still come back but maybe try a different dish.

The donut flavours were not my first few choices since most of them were sold out around 5pm. It was also my first time having Dunkin' Donuts and the donuts were absolutely amazing! The Blueberry Filled donut was what I expected it to be but the Bavarian Filled donut had an interesting flavour, however I wish there were more fillings inside. You also cannot go wrong with the Sugar Raised donuts and honestly only getting one was not enough. I would definitely try more flavours next time since I really enjoyed my late afternoon snack :) - a year ago | (1⭐) A Disappointing Experience

I recently visited a Dunkin' Donuts outlet and was left feeling frustrated and disappointed by the customer service.

When I was deciding on my order, the staff member insisted that I purchase four donuts to receive a box. While I understand the desire to minimize waste, it felt inflexible and inconvenient, especially for a smaller order.

Moreover, the lack of a larger bag to carry the individual paper bags was surprising. It seemed like a minor detail, but it added to the overall inconvenience of the experience.

While Dunkin' Donuts has historically offered boxes for smaller orders, this recent experience suggests a potential downgrade in customer service. It's important to remember that good customer service can significantly impact a customer's overall satisfaction.

I hope that Dunkin' Donuts will take steps to improve their customer service policies and training to ensure a more positive experience for future customers. - 2 months ago | (3⭐) Sweet treat is not for me, but I do drop here to pack these colourful, vibrant, attractive and hunger calling donuts.

Hahaha... I say is it ok looking like this? The bright short round girl said yes its like that if less ice...

My personal favourite is the classic original and also the chicken floss. Recently prefer chicken floss as the savoury taste of the chicken floss match well with the sweet batter of eggette.

Most of time quality are ok but on and off they slipped in quality where the product are soggy and the side are not crispy.

Overall are good.

Didn’t purchase at my first time visit because the queue was way toooooo long. It was my second visit few days ago, and I waited around 15mins to collect my order. Consider quick..?

Tried their original classic eggette. It was crunchy at the outside, soft on the inside. Smell good, but the taste for me was so so only. Not the best eggette I have ever tried.

Would revisit and try other flavours, if there is no long queue. 😛 - 3 years ago | (5⭐) The food is really nice.

Then, i would say a 4 ⭐️ but this day, sigh…
We had:
- dumpling - the pork inside was warm not hot. But the kids like them.
- sweet and sour chicken - chicken has that strong overnight chicken taste. Nothing special. I ate more of the onions than the chicken.
- HK Kailan - huge kailan and were not properly cut. It was kind of difficult to eat. Taste wise nothing special. Just blenched vegetables with some sauce that were not that great
- soup - we order peanut soup and lotus root soup. One soup came. Piping hot. Which was good. But taste wise…not that great. Kids who loves soup didnt even finished it. The other soup, waiter came much later to say peanut soup no more. So we changed it to pig stomach. It didnt make it to our table till we almost finished our meal. And the soup wasnt even hot. Never had double boiled soup like that before. The boil was only medium warm 😣
- drinks - ordered 3 only 2 came. 😵‍💫 - 4 months ago | (3⭐) Got pulled in because seen the Hot and spicy soup, and the Xiao Long Bao from their menu, and no queue. (Maybe that is not a good sign, on Saturday evening, in one of the most busy mall in town)

Price wise on the dishes portion is consider cheap, in a mall. But the taste……

Dong Po rou 东坡肉, will say is very disappointed, soy sauce with some lettuce? Xiao Long Bao, seriously, nothing like Xiao Long Bao, if it just call it pork dumplings will be fine. Mixed vegetables stir fried prawns, just taste of oyster sauce 😂

In 1981, the company's products became available in the Soviet Union. The Estée Lauder brand has had sometimes high-profile spokesmodels, sometimes referred to simply as 'faces'. Past 'faces' for Estée Lauder include Karen Graham, Bruce Boxleitner, Shaun Casey, Willow Bay, Paulina Porizkova, Elizabeth Hurley, Carolyn Murphy, supermodel Liya Kebede was the first African American 'face' of Estee Lauder, Anja Rubik, and actress Gwyneth Paltrow.

We politely thanked the staff, but three of them rolled their eyes and said, ""It's Channellllll, not Estée Lauder,"" in a very rude tone, particularly the Malay staff member.

With such untrained staff, I guess there's no hope for my mom to try any of your products.

I didn’t have coins either to which Yasmin then responded “well what do you want me to do” and stared at me waiting for me to provide a solution. In the end she cancelled the purchase. - 2 weeks ago | (5⭐) Ordered a lot of cookies n needed to pack nicely with ribbon.
We came during the late evening, took them 3 hours to do. This is the biggest order, according to the outlet.
They did OT until 11.30pm without complaining. When we came to collect, everything was packed nicely. And can see that they're very tired. But still put on a smile when they hand us the cookies.

Thank you very much for the best customer service ever by the 2 Malay girls🙏🏻❤️
Thanks to them, we are able to get all of the cookies gifts for the next day's event. - 6 months ago | (1⭐) this happened 2 months ago. There was 2 cashier, 1 malay girl and another one too (i didnt pay attention at this person). So this malay cashier was at the counter and i asked her this cookie, before she even proceeded to scoop out the cookie she showed attitude. It was ok i let it brush out but the simplest thing as a worker in a any store need to be patience right but this girl as if she dont want any customers she straight up says the bill. What the hell?? Without even asking “is there anymore else maam” , not even that she just said this much (to pay) hello i can buy the whole shop if i wanted to do it. There is no manners or whatsoever. Just because i were choosing much more, she removed the glass window (which is normal i understand) but she literally banged that down (glass window) :) i just stared and just start pointing out without speaking because i reallly dont like her and her attitude/manners. Then during payment finish she didnt hand out the cookies instead bang it on the counter. There is a difference of just putting down and slam/bang on it. I can hear that sound of bang. I really lose my shit on there and wanted to scold her. I had endured every stages she has showed me , not necessarily to bang my cookies which I bought in MY MONEY not hers at all. We are the one paying her, if she cannot show a proper service dont work lah. Why are you making yourself a joke to the public. Even you have a major problem in home dont show that in your work place, work place is not a space for you to release your anger especially to your customers. I did not scold her and decided to stop going to Sunway Pyramid Famous Amos outlet anymore. This malay girl was wearing a glasses , i didnt saw the name but yes she was really a bad cashier. Better fire her. If she is not treating her customers well then no need to work. Very bad service. - 5 months ago | (1⭐) Both of the staff are very rude especially Yasmin.

It's a place where Asian comfort food takes center stage, and their Taiwanese Hot Crispy Chicken Rice Set exemplifies this perfectly.

This dish, priced from RM19.50, is a true indulgence. It features crispy, slightly spicy fried chicken served flat out, accompanied by their incredibly flavorful braised sauce and a bed of tofu rice. This combination of textures and flavors is nothing short of addictive.

The Taiwanese Hot Crispy Chicken Rice Set doesn't stop at the chicken alone; it includes a full meal experience. Alongside the crispy chicken, you'll find a serving of braised sauce-topped rice, with the option to add a braised egg, tofu, or both, depending on your preference. To complete the meal, it even comes with a refreshing bubble milk tea.

For those looking to elevate their culinary adventure, an extra plate of Taiwanese sausage is a wise choice. When everything is combined and generously topped with their garlicy chili sambal paste, the flavors harmonize in a symphony of deliciousness that's sure to leave your taste buds dancing.

Formosa has earned its reputation as a go-to spot for students in the area seeking a quick and satisfying lunch or dinner. With its reasonable prices and substantial food portions, it offers a dining experience that's not only delicious but also budget-friendly. - a year ago | (3⭐) Lo bak spinach noodle not nice at all as it is soggy .

I purchased a phone case from this shop because my old one was broken. I asked the guy (circled in red) if they had a phone case for the Honor 50. He mentioned that since the Honor 50 is an older model, it was lucky they had one last piece in stock. Trusting his word, I decided to purchase it without asking the price, there was no price tag label on the phone case packaging.

At the counter, he started cleaning my phone screen without asking me first. After that, he charged me RM69 for the phone case—much more than I expected! When I politely asked if there was any discount, he only reduced the price by RM2, bringing it to RM67. I reluctantly paid and left the shop, but after discussing it with my friend, my friend and I felt that the guy ""scammed"" me since similar phone cases are sold on Shopee for RM10-30.

Within an hour, I returned to the shop with the receipt to request a refund. However, the guy refused, saying that once the package is opened, they cannot resell it. I considered reporting this to MDTCA, but the process would take too long. I strongly advise anyone to not visiting this shop. - 2 months ago | (5⭐) Good service!

Avenn was incredibly professional, managing everything from A-Z with great care and a friendly, welcoming attitude.

It was my first visit to this salon, and what stood out to me was their approach. They recommend treatments based on your hair condition and explain every step of the process so you’re always in the loop. They also inform you of any promotions without being hard sell. Since I’m a hijabi, I opted for a private room.

Highly recommended! - 3 months ago | (5⭐) Very skilled and professional hairstylist! Additionally, humor too! Good customer service and beautiful environment, offered water and snacks, recommended! Pls look Avenn Goh! - 7 months ago | (5⭐) Walk in on a Thursday evening for a quick haircut. At first, I was a little surprised by the price of a simple cut and wash. But overall I feel it's worth it as the stylist (Moon) was very meticulous and cuts my hair carefully. Usually my hair cuts end up with more misses, so I'm very resistant with layering my hair.

The end results looks great on me, so I also decided to upgrade and get a scalp treatment. - 3 months ago | (5⭐) Thank you, Moon, for the great service and hairstyle recommendation! worth the price.

While the dishes are well-presented and the flavors are decent, they don’t offer the bold, unforgettable taste one might expect from a Michelin-starred chef. For the price, the portion sizes feel a bit lacking, leaving it hard to justify the value for money. A nice experience for those looking to try a celebrity chef’s restaurant, but there are better options for the price in KL. - a month ago | (5⭐) My husband and I had a delightful afternoon tea here on Valentine’s Day, and it was an experience to remember. From the moment we arrived, the staff were incredibly warm, professional, and attentive, ensuring we felt welcomed and well taken care of.

The ambience was elegant yet cosy, creating the perfect setting for a relaxing afternoon. To make the occasion even more special, a live violinist performed romantic melodies, adding a beautiful touch to the atmosphere.

The afternoon tea selection was beautifully presented, featuring a wonderful assortment of freshly made pastries, sandwiches, and fine teas. One of the highlights was Gordon’s signature Beef Wellington, which was cooked to perfection—crispy on the outside, tender and flavorful on the inside. Every dish was crafted with high-quality ingredients and impeccable attention to detail.

Despite the exceptional quality of the food and service, the price was quite reasonable, making it a great value for the experience provided. Everything from the service to the ambience exceeded our expectations. It was a truly enjoyable and romantic afternoon, and we would highly recommend this place for anyone looking for an elegant yet affordable afternoon tea experience.

Bought it for a staggering price of 159 and turns out it doesn't work with pcs or any games I had but when I checked the games setting they all supported Xbox controllers while most of them didn't do PS4.

Libby was so helpful and kind. She made the whole shopping experience a pleasure. - 5 months ago | (1⭐) The customer service I experienced from them is all good until I brought my ring to Sunway Pyramid Goldheart on 28 September 2024 to do size adjustment. The adjustment was done on the day and I’ve tried it as well.

They say engraving have to wait till the next day 12pm only can be done, on Sunday I called them they said the ring can be done before 2pm. Unfortunately at 1pm when I’m on my way to Sunway Pyramid I received a call from them, said that the engraving can only be done after 4pm. So I’m not able to collect it on Sunday because I don’t want to waste my time waiting there.

Today 1 October Tuesday, I went to collect my ring but the condition is bad, the surface of the ring is scratched. What I’m angry the most is the staff no inform me at the phone about this until I go and collect it they also didn’t mention about anything to me until I saw the scratches on the ring. I asked them why is it like this. Their answer is this can only be fixed at Hong Kong in 2-3 months time. I send a good condition ring over but received a scratched ring? The staff didn’t mention anything about before I ask. The staff should have realise this issue before hand and inform customer and give customer solution to solve this. When the staff handover to me, she just said, the ring is done adjustment and engraving please check, they didn’t even admit they are sorry for scratched the ring and how they can solve it until I ask them. And the scratches are on top of the ring I don’t believe no one else has seen it.

This kind of customer service attitude are bad because it’s not about how far I came to collect it or am I urgently need to use the ring. We bought the marriage ring to wear it not just to use it. It Is the customer expectation to collect a beautiful fit ring from the shop.

Kindly train your staff again and provide a right compensation to customer. Thank you. - 5 months ago | (5⭐) Professional friendly staff here

Was there this afternoon.
Only 1 Malay lady manning the store.
She ignored me for 30 secs, while we waited at the counter, waiting for her to serve us.

We have to call her to make an order, obviously she saw us all the while.
She then reply with a sour grape face say wait. Then I saw there is QR on the counter and I proceed to scan the QR and play my phone.
She then continue ignore me after done her wiping. Another client come and she served them and continue ignore me.
The QR link to a order website but is pointed to ss15 branch. After ordering show to she, she say not sure if can switch to here Sunway branch. In the end I need go ss15 branch to collect my drink.

Service was immaculate, friendly and accommodating. Definitely will come again. Do say Hi to Chef Gordon 😁. - in the last week | (3⭐) The pizza is a disappointment. It is not piping hot when served. Probably was cooked earlier? The dough is not soft and the toppings are too little for the price paid - RM 62 for one.

Highly recommend! - 6 months ago | (1⭐) My mum ordered 3 hand pastel portraits from this girl in Dec 22, took 3 months and still was not ready in March 23, had to chase to to get the portraits, could not cancel as paid deposit. Had a first portrait hand drawn pastel that was done in Oct 22 - it was decent, so decided to have extra 3 more done which took longer, when received, the strokes of the the new hand pastel art looked different from the 1st received in Oct, looks really good and exact detailing, but on detail inspection - seems like a  combination of digital art and hand pastel? shown to another artists and 'digital art' was mentioned on first look without second thought. My mum called her and queried about the artwork and would like a replacement as she was not happy with it, but the girl say that she can buy a new one instead and deny digital art work by saying 'oh is there is such a thing?' to the word 'digital art'. Sounds very dodgy and would not recommend her unless she is drawing in front of you or made it clear 100% hand drawn. Very disappointed in how this is managed as the response from the girl is very questionable, with possibility of dishonesty and no transparency. We would be understanding if she would have declared if it was not full 100% hand drawn. - a year ago | (5⭐) Paintings look vivid! - 2 years ago | (5⭐) No Review - a month ago",Green Pasture,+60 12-202 8279,"Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Tuesday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Wednesday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Thursday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Friday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Saturday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Sunday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM"

Enjoy, Diana💋 - 3 months ago | (1⭐) I am writing to share feedback about my recent experience at your store involving one of your cashiers, Nurul.

While waiting in line at her counter, there was no signage indicating that the counter was closed. When I reached her, she instructed me to go to another counter, which was already occupied with refund issues. After some time, I noticed that she reopened the counter and served another customer instead of inviting me back.

This situation caused unnecessary inconvenience and frustration. I would appreciate it if you could address this matter and ensure clearer communication in the future to improve the overall customer experience.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. - a month ago | (5⭐) I recently did my AIA Vitality health check here, and the pharmacist, En. Naim, was extremely helpful and patient.

Tried the Coconut Mango Boom, and it was truly a decent drink! The combination of coconut and mango was refreshing, making it a perfect choice for a warm day.

The way they cook it is fantastic, and it keeps me coming back. Unfortunately, on my recent visit, the pork intestine was unavailable, which was disappointing. I enjoy both the baby spicy and original flavors, but I prefer the original with extra garlic. However, this time, the garlic tasted off—almost spoiled, which was a letdown.

The soup has been consistently good since my first visit, and it didn’t disappoint this time either. I also tried the cheese mantou today. While the exterior was crispy and nice, the cheese filling had a strange low-quality plastic container smell, and when eaten together, it tasted slightly sour. It wasn’t a pleasant experience.

Unfortunately, the dry hotpot here isn’t great at all👎👎. It’s too bland, just plain spicy and lack of good flavor (i don’t know why they wana add cumin flavor into it cos it’s actually meant for chinese bbq but they added this into dry hotpot which made it really weird). Nevertheless, the mala soup actually tastes really good 👍(but you get the same flavour from Master Kang instant noodles🤣) .

Another thing that put me off  is the so-called member price. It’s free to join then you get discount, but why bother to require that when you already allow everyone join for free. Wasting time and just finding excuse to charge more. Price actually is quite reasonable though. But overall i won’t go back to this brand outlets again. 😅

Finally reminder, when you select the pork or beef, it is usually rolled up so it’s easy to clip, MAKE SURE you tell the counter that you don’t want it to be cut into smaller pieces, my pork belly roll mysteriously ended up as 2 small pieces only 😹. I have read many others commented the same issues but i rather not presume that is the fact.. now i tried and proved that those claims were pretty accurate 🤣🤣 - 7 months ago | (5⭐) Actually for first try is not bad, all the vegetables and meat are fresh choice a lot (that’s my favorite part), food and service is good but still can improve.

But the quality & taste of ice cream had drop tremendously but the price is also increased tremendously on ice cream creations. The colour of Green tea favour is NO longer dark green. There are many new comer & new brand in the market are much better taste than this brand. Please do more research & innovation or just close shop to prevent more losses - 9 months ago | (5⭐) Their staff are very friendly, helpful and polite. Their ice cream is so delicious and gooodddd! I love their service and place to sit is comfortable. The best part is I got to taste the sample first before I can make my decision to buy. Overall, I love to buy my ice cream from here. I would highly recommend everyone to go here and get YOUR OWN ICE CREAM ✨ - a month ago | (1⭐) I ordered coffee-flavored ice cream. To my surprise, for the price, I paid for a single scoop I was given a small scoop, nearly half of the cup. So stingy to be generous to give a nice big scoop that nicely fits the cup. I nicely complained to the Chinese guy about it, and all he said was that's how it's being served! He couldn't be careless to rectify the situation. I told him overseas they are so generous to give us a big scoop! I do not understand why the management failed to take action. There are plenty of ice cream companies that serve even better than Haagen Dasz. - 6 months ago",Häagen-Dazs,+60 3-5613 7826,"Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Tuesday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Wednesday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Thursday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Friday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Saturday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Sunday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM"

The food is about the same, so that's good. The service is also not bad. In those regards, they're the quite similar. The ambience and atmosphere, however, is much better here. There is a lot more space, and it's got a more chilled vibe in comparison. The menu is also extensive, so there's something for everyone.

Service is pretty friendly. Seating is both ample and spacious.

Interior deco at the entrance has a Japanese feel.

The food however is mediocre is both taste and quality compared to the price you pay. Not bad but not great either.

The sake quality is also mediocre, At a range of RM150++, again you get what you pay for.

Overall, an acceptable place for a Japanese meal but nothing awesome. - 2 months ago | (5⭐) Food was decent and also fresh during my dining. Staff was pretty friendly from start till end of the service experience.

What was previously worn as an essential beachwear, has now become an icon of fun, fashion and casualness that will accompany you no matter how far your feet take you. With over 50 years of history in the footwear retailer industry, this Brazilian brand’s first pair was actually based on the traditional Japanese Zori sandals which use rice straw to create the soles. How the brand makes its flit flops and sandals iconic is by it trademark design, creating the texture of their rubber soles to appear like rice grains. Even before crossing international borders, the brand first gained recognition from foreign countries when tourists would love to them home as gifts, or even to sell in their home country. Havaianas’ footwear isn’t just iconic, it gives you top quality to match its reputation, claiming that their flit flops and sandals don’t lose their shape, don’t smell and their straps don’t come loose. Over the years, the brand has evolved and adapted with trends, which led to the birth of new footwear from them, including sneakers and espadrilles to cater to fans who live in countries with climates that require something warmer than flit flops. Translating the rubber flit flops into the soles of the sneaker showcases how the brand retains its symbolic feature into its latest creations.

I understand about their concern but I really don’t understand their attitude. - 4 months ago | (1⭐) It would be great if we can review without giving any star. From all the reviews I read about this store on their customer service , all are very bad. Same here , just bought a white long skirt for my daughter. Before that, we found other colours available but not white . We spotted the same piece in white but was on the mannequin so we politely asked if we could get that ? There are 2 female staff (one taller and slimmer whereas the other one is on the chubby side ). The slimmer staff threw us a weird look when we asked for the piece on the mannequin  and she did not answer us immediately but informed her colleague about our request and after that the slimmer staff came back to  us and rudely told us ‘white one cannot try’. I said OK..  both staff are not friendly and they looked as if they have never been trained to serve customer and don’t know the right way to even communicate. Very bad for the shop cos after so many bad reviews , it seems owner of the business has done nothing to improve. - 2 months ago | (1⭐) Staff ：Make sure you try already will buy

The display item didn’t have S size, so I went to the counter and ask them for S size, and they told me I can’t try white clothes, which I’m not going to try it on. After that one of the worker gave me S size but there was some make up stain on the skirt so I went again and ask them if they could exchange another one for me, they told me so rudely again that I can’t try on, I said I’m not going to. It’s just the skirt is dirty, which I would want another one. Then they just ask me so rudely whether I want to buy or not. Omg I feel so criticised by their words. and they didn’t even say sorry to me.

recommended - 3 months ago | (4⭐) Had lunch at Ichiban Ramen and tried the spicy Ichiban ramen. The ramen noodles were perfectly kenyal (springy) and had a nice texture, which I really enjoyed! However, the broth could use a bit more kick—the spice level was milder than expected and didn't quite hit the mark.

The environment was comfortable, not too hot or too cold, which was nice. I ordered the lunch set, but it required an additional RM3 for an iced lemon tea, which felt a bit off since you'd expect the set to be a better value without add-ons.

The service was okay, though sometimes it took a while to get the staff's attention as they didn’t always check for raised hands. Overall, an okay experience, but a few improvements would make it even better - 3 months ago | (3⭐) Food was ok, even though it could have been better. The chicken slightly dry. Ramen also slightly pricey to compare with big bowl but normal portion (at least to us lah). Ramen soup also ok-lah just like that. AND do not add on extra chilli. Not worth it to pay for small chilli plate size. The kimchi fried rice quite decent. Can come and try but might not come again so soon. - 3 weeks ago | (5⭐) Decided to go there for a quick lunch Service was great especially by the waiter Daniel He was super attentive Price was reasonable for the lunch set which comes with a drink, fruit and soup - 3 months ago | (3⭐) Quite busy.

Everything is good on products, promotion and services. The previous Manager was very professional, and the current one is very experienced. But nowadays I don’t see much variety and colours of this brand anymore, many products has discontinued, it is getting more & more casual and simple, the colour & shape of products are almost the same and very difficult to identify the item that I am looking for until I read the shelf taller or told & explain by the staff. I really miss the colours, and hope that it will be back again in future - 8 months ago | (5⭐) had a very pleasant experience this evening at innisfree! the staff was very attentive, friendly and knowledgeable as she explained each products that would suit me. she also wrote a note for my future reference! :) thank you! - 5 months ago | (1⭐) Absolutely racist.

So i just told her i wanted to pay and i left after paying. I was in and out for less than 3 mins because of this experience. I will never step foot in this innisfree anymore.

Question:

1. Is it the SOP that takeaway customers are not allowed to be seated in order to view the menu & make the selection?

The restaurant was only a handful of customers since it was after lunch hour (1521 hours). Thus, there are a lot of empty tables. In addition, there were no customer queuing anyway.

2. Is it the SOP that takeaway customers is warranted to wait outside of the restaurant while awaiting for the meal to be ready?

It really baffles me that I was not allowed to be seated because I have chose to takeway my meals.

The waitress in a way insisted me to wait outside for my meal, whereas, I have ordered 2 drinks for dine-in (the drinks were noted as takeaway in the receipt, even though I have stated otherwise).

If not because of one (1) of the waiter (a gentleman), I would have to stand outside while waiting for my meal.

A combo meal of rice or noodles with lemontea drink each for only rm 10+-.

The taste is very flavorful too.

Our rice portion is huge! Like huge covering the entire plate with fried rice. Sorry my picture shown is after i consume almost of it haha

The asam laksa soup base is very rich! Kaw!

Plus they have various sources/condiment too

And the young chap here is very nice, who served us to the table to be sitted.

Definitely recommended to try out. Value for money especially in a shopping mall. ✌️ - 5 months ago | (2⭐) I came not expecting anything bcos at the special promo price for food and drinks, I can't ask for much at an outlet in a mall. But this is really way below my expectations. I gv two stars out of consideration bcos, shop still need to do business. The taste of prawns noodles soup is terrible, I can't force myself to finish. - 4 weeks ago | (4⭐) Lala soup was decent though it went cold very quickly, would’ve been better if there was a way to keep it hot. Assam laksa also nice, value for money with lemon tea at RM10.90 - a month ago | (1⭐) Was very surprise to see a dead mini cockcroach inside my soup. They've made changes. Serve a new soup. But the experience was terrifying and traumatic. Sanitary measure inside kitchen should be given a full check up. - a month ago | (5⭐) First time trying here, the Assam laksa is good. Very thick soup with generous ingredients inside. Not too big or too small either. Price is considered cheap even though it's inside the shopping mall.

Enjoy Jollibee's bestsellers such as the world-famous Chickenjoy - delicately hand-breaded for a crispy exterior, cooked with precision for maximum juiciness, and marinated to the bone for next-level flavour. For those who love a hot kick to their fried chicken, Jollibee offers Spicy Chickenjoy which is coated with fiery breading and infused with a signature spicy marinade. Some of the other crowd pleasers includes the Jolly Spaghetti, prepared with its signature sweet-style sauce, loaded with chunky slices of beef sausage and generously topped with cheese, and the Yumburger is Jollibee’s version of the hamburger and a favourite that can be ordered with or without cheese.",LG2.126A (Lower Ground 2 Floor),"(4⭐) Came by for a quick late lunch since there was almost no queue at the ordering kiosks. The orders were quickly fulfilled via a numbered ticket on your order receipt.

Taste wise, biting into either their fried chicken or beef burgers is quite nostalgic if you have had their offerings from childhood. It still tastes pretty decent and some of the menu options on display do reflect the pinoy influence on the menu options here. All in all, a decent alternative to the competition at the Golden Arches and other similar outlets. Oh, and they have Mountain Dew. Recommended if you've never tried this or used to enjoy their offerings as a kid. - 5 months ago | (5⭐) First time tried Jollibees. Love it. Fried chickens taste different from others franchise. Like the sweetness of the spaghetti (suit for my kid). Kinda fond with pineapple juice to cleanse the taste after the meal. Mashed potatoes not too soft and the gravy not thick which I preferred thick. Coleslaw fresh and sweet. Unfortunately service kinda slow. - 6 months ago | (2⭐) This isn't my first visit here, but my most recent visit left me dissappointed with the food. I ordered the Burger steak thay comes with a rice and a burger patty. Needless to say, check out my photo to see how depressing that burger patty looks. I had to hold it up with a fork to take this photo or else its so thin that it sinks beneath the sauce. The taste was ok, but portion was really not worth the money.
The only saving grace was the peach mango pie which has been my all-time favourite.
Will I be back? Maybe, but I would go for the Jolly spaghetti or chicken next time. - 5 months ago | (4⭐) My first time trying Jollibee yesterday. I ordered a set which had 1 piece of chicken, a burger, spagetti and a drink. And I added an ala carte hotdog so that I get to try a wide range of their food.
The burger was relatively small in size but the taste of the burger meat was pretty nice, compared to other fast food burgers. It had a pleasant distinct smoky flavour.
Am happy they had spagetti because I love spagetti.
The special thing about their fried chicken was their brown sauce which had herb taste in it. And the chicken seasoning was nice too.
The sausage in the hot dog tasted good too - it had a unique smoky taste to it too. The BBQ sauce was a tad too sweet and overpowering.
A bit disappointed their drink was not re-fillable.

A shout out to the sweet server staff who help bring the whole lot of food to my table instead having me go collect to food fm the counter myself. - 11 months ago | (2⭐) It is very disappointing that rice and chicken together only got very small portion of gravy, cannot add on extra gravy also, the cleanliness of the seat also quite bad, need to self service to clean up the table and eat.

It look good and cozy but it is below my expectations due to space as it is not as big as the branches in Jaya Shopping Centre PJ, Starling Mall PJ and Sunway GEO Avenue. Anyway, so far so good but lots of work on improvement on shelf arrangements, merchandise displays and stabilisation of the self service cashier check out counters need to be done, as this is the very good potential location in Subang Jaya area.

Raised a serious food safety concern with Nutriplus and customer service, but the response was pathetic. Days passed with no meaningful reply or action. No escalation to a manager, no urgency, just radio silence. And to top it off, they tried upselling me in their response? Are you kidding?

Yesterday got worst experience in Sunway Pyramid. I realize foreigners working really in bad manner. I just try out one short dress and return because is not suitable, the staff show me black face and talk my bad in front of me. Your shop is not allow people on trying then please put a BIG SIGNAGE OUTSIDE. Please consider before you try or please try after you buy. This kind of words. So disgusting that your dress is not that clean as well to let customer try on. I wont go your shop again. - 4 months ago | (5⭐) Jin Hayari Sunway Pyramid offers a great selection of stylish clothes that look fantastic. The quality is impressive, and the fabrics feel durable. Best of all, the prices are affordable. Recommended - 5 months ago | (1⭐) The short hair lady refused to let me try on the dress I wanted
I was afraid I had misunderstood her and even double-checked with her to see if the dress I was looking at could be tried on, and she did not disappoint me. She said the dress didn't fit me. I asked if the customer insisted on trying it on, couldn't she do that too?
She replied in a very firm tone: ""Yes, you can't.""
I was like wow, this store owner has trained a very good staff and very principled.
What I want to say is that customers have to try it on only know whether it suits them or not, they DON’T NEED YOUR STAFF TO CONCLUDE. She behaved so rude - a year ago | (5⭐) I like the service of the boy-cut hairstyle retail representative. She knows her stuff well and offered suitable size for me to try on, and even helped tidying up my dress after I had put it on, checked with me if she tied the waist too tight, and even offered a heel for me to wear for the long dress I tried.

Initially I got a smaller size for the first piece, she had a look on my size and offer me a bigger pieces.
Next when I wanna try the second piece, she offer me a smaller size and told me that the cutting is much bigger, so advice me to try the size first, if I needed a bigger size, then I can let her know.

This is exactly the service we need to get whenever we’re in fashion shop. Not some representative who just stand there and following us only.

Kudos to you, thank you so much, I’ve always wanna tried your dress, and the experience today makes me wanna have a second visit. - 2 years ago | (1⭐) WILL NEVER SHOP HERE AGAIN. i was in the sunway branch with my sister, while my sister was looking at dresses, the store clerk lady came up to her and told her nothing in the store would fit her. we asked if there was an L size for the dress and she said even that would not fit her and even placed the dress on my sister as if showing her that it would not fit. i asked if my sister could try the dress on and the lady kept saying it would not fit. i kept insisting on letting her try and the lady finally gave in but demanded that she would be the one pulling the zipper on the dress for my sister. in the end the dress did fit, but my sister did not show the lady as it was not worth her (my sister’s) time to go back and forth with the lady again. when we passed the dress to the lady as we were about to leave, she called us to stay and look at her test if the zipper was broken. it was absurd. why hire a clothes store clerk that bodyshame women??? i understand that its hard to employ people, but there should at least be a standard. overall, never shopping there again. - 2 years ago",Jin Hayari Sunway Pyramid,+60 3-5612 2228,"Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Tuesday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Wednesday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Thursday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Friday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Saturday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Sunday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM"

The atmosphere is cozy and comfortable, with air conditioning making it a pleasant place to dine. However, do note that weekends can get busy, and you might need to queue.

As for the food, the polo bun is a standout—fresh and flavorful. The cheese rice is decent but has room for improvement. The croissant egg tart, while unique, was a bit too sweet for my taste, though others might enjoy it more.

Overall, it's worth a visit for the cozy ambiance and to try the signature items. - 2 months ago | (2⭐) Came in for lunch and we ordered the wanton soup noodle and the steamed pork patty with salted fish.

What was unpleasant is the shark fin soup.

Their quality are always consistent.

Few of my favourite are mango passion, strawberry kiss and banana blast. Haven’t try their greenery option.

The only complaint will be the price point. Is getting way more expensive compared to other fruit beverage maker. Hopefully they can price back appropriately to the market level as around 20 ringgit for fruit juices is a bit too expensive. Should cap around 15 or lesser. Anyway hope they can sustain their market as competition are a lot and consumers have other choices too. - 3 months ago | (2⭐) Had the dragon sparkle which was good as well as the lychee paradise which was a let down.

We ordered the healthy drink Power size with #myDigi app promotion. The staff poured the drink to the Power size cup and it wasn't full so she added a cup of ice and blended again to pour it into the cup to make it full. We drank it and it was too bland and tasteless. We nicely feedback to the staffs and the replies we got was it's bland because it's health drink without yogurt in it and both the staffs keep insisting that's the reason the juice got bland. We then told them that they have added so much ice into it and they kept insisting they only add in half cup of ice which we saw there are a total of 2 full cup of ice (before blended the first round and 2nd round another cup). They didn't want to take responsibility for it and just simply give reasons to shoo us away instead of helping the paying customers. We then went to the cashier to tell the cashier thinking she might be the person who could at least solve the problem but she just acted blur and turned away. The staffs also asked us to move away and not blocking the cashier for other customers to make payment which then there were no customers behind us. This is SUPER RUDE. One of the staff then get our drink and then asked to pour away the ice but it was blended and we wonder how she would do that to pour away the ice? We saw her just pour the drink out to the blender and pour some juice away into the sink then pour back into the cup. And guess what the content becomes even lesser and the TASTE IS STILL BLAND. The staffs are trying to CHEAT on customers CONSTANTLY. We were so tired of their NONSENSE. At last the staff took the drink back and pour back into the blender and add one tiny piece of pineapple to add abit of taste to blend. It had a bit of taste but still the TASTE IS OFF. We were so TIRED OF talking to them anymore which lead to deaf ears so we just walked away with the healthy drink that just taste like WATER.

Satay chicken burger

✅️ bigger chicken fillet size

Although we waited for quite awhile because kitchen was preparing but for the crispiness it is acceptable.

Krispy Kreme Malaysia 🇲🇾 has come up with 3 superb flavours in conjunction of the Ramadan month 🌙. So we managed to try the ..
-Ketayap 🍩. Based on the local snack “kuih ketayap” which is stuffed with sweetened coconut filling and pandan juice . So yeaaa.. the sweetness does replicate the pandan and the coconut 🥥 filling was a great addition.

-Eid Ketupat🍩. Based on Ketupat prints , which is rice packed inside a diamond-shaped container of woven palm leaf pouch.
The outer layer is colour icing sugar and the inside is a custard cream ... superb bonus 😋

-Almond London🍩. Based on local famous chocolate almond cookies. It has a coat of chocolate 🍫, topped with biscuit and almond crumbles. This is our least favourite among all.

-Double chocolate 🍩. Well this is one of the favourite of all time , Chocolate toppings and chocolate filling 🍫🍫🤟. That’s a double hit combo !!

Happy Friday!!!

And the staff was ignoring us while we are standing waiting to be served. Not just that, none of them are smiling at all. The worst customer service ever for Krispy Kreme. - a year ago | (3⭐) I think I prefer Dunkin Donuts than Krispy Kreme.
Their texture, jam, fillings and toppings, all of these, I think Dunkin is better
But I have to say their Powdered Strawberry Filled is nice. The jam wasn’t that sweet and you can eat  some strawberry flesh inside.
Others were just normal.
Price is reasonable.

I bought this One Dozen Assorted Doughnuts on grab, and I only get 3 non-chocolate donuts 🥲
Sweetened chocolate easy to get jelak and seriously don’t know how they distribute the donuts flavor 🥲 - 3 years ago",Krispy Kreme @ Sunway Pyramid,+60 3-5611 5268,"Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Tuesday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Wednesday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Thursday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Friday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Saturday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Sunday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM"

Kwan Kee Store, a Michelin-recognized spot, is a must-visit for those who appreciate traditional Hong Kong pastries. Their dedication to authentic flavors and quality ingredients is evident in their offerings.

The white sugar sponge cake stands out with its light, fluffy texture and just the right level of sweetness—perfect for those who prefer a more delicate taste. The steamed red bean cake and pandan cake are also excellent, packed with red beans and maintaining a balanced, natural flavor without being overly sweet.

However, the Musang King rice roll falls a bit short. While the concept is interesting, it lacks the strong durian fragrance that one might expect from Musang King, leaving room for improvement in flavor intensity.

Price is on the high side, some might think worth it but some might not. - in the last week | (4⭐) I've tried a few items but I don't remember the names. The service was really good, there was a guy who was very friendly and explained the snacks to us. Sadly, this branch is just a no-seat brach that brings only a number of items. I've been eyeing other snacks from their instagram but it's a bit hard to go to the main store. Anyway, I really like the mango flavoured roll, not sure what it's called, but you can see the photo. - in the last week | (5⭐) It's more like a take away concept, although there is a couple of seats, but it looks more like a waiting area.

I spent RM11 for the original kebab and RM6 for the add on. Unbelievable! Small chicken bits and it’s really daylight robbery. Will not buy again. Very disappointed. - 4 months ago | (1⭐) Wanted to take away something quick for child on the way back home. This must be one of the worst kebab purchases I made locally. RM11 and it contains little chicken (taken from some Tupperware, not cut in front of you), hard bread and last minute 'put into toaster' action. Basically threw it away, regretful purchase. Nothing against the 'foreigner' manning this kiosk, it's just not worth it. Any Subway is few hundred times better. - 8 months ago | (1⭐) This shop used to be my favourite back then. But recently came here for beef kebab + extra kebab + canned soft drinks that cost me RM30 (I didn’t take the receipt since I always came here). The kebab doesn’t really taste like meat kebab. More to kebab with chilli sauce & a lil bit of cabbage. I don’t know why its getting so expensive but they don’t maintain the service. How can you put extra charge and reduce the meat at the same time. It’s not worth it. RM30 can get better food elsewhere. Sila mereput. Bye. - a year ago | (1⭐) Bought meat kebab. Got only vege with lots of sauce. Very less meat portion. Pricy. A few years back was better.Now not worth it at all! The owner must have told the staff to make like a million kebabs from the small portion of meat. Look at the photo. Hardly can see any meat. Not gonna repeat ever. - 2 years ago | (5⭐) I understand they have to reduce meat because of rising costs and rent. Those who rely on a fixed income (makan gaji) will never understand. So, in order to get the same taste as 20 years ago, I will order 'extra meat'. It tastes so good!

We had the avocado milk & avocado coffee on both occasions. There were good although a bit sweet. The coffee version is the best. Interesting combination.

Staff are so “professional” that they think shouting at customers is the best way to help. We just needed guidance on using the membership app, but apparently, not knowing how to use it is offensive enough to deserve an attitude.

Love how their staff bring personal emotions to work — because, you know, throwing tantrums at customers is the true mark of professionalism. Aren’t we all impressed by how well they manage their emotions? Truly inspiring behavior from grown adults.

As first-time users of your membership program, we simply wanted to accumulate our membership points and sought guidance from a female staff member on how to do so. However, she bluntly told us, ""No, you can’t."" When we approached her again later, she suddenly changed her response and said that the QR code had to be scanned before making payment. Unfortunately, she had not informed us of this earlier. Since there were other customers present, we proceeded with the payment, unaware that we would miss out on earning our points.

Feeling helpless and frustrated, we turned to a male staff member for assistance. Instead of offering help in a professional manner, he raised his voice in an attempt to intimidate us. When we reasoned with him, he accused my girlfriend of being rude and aggressive toward the female staff member. This was absolutely untrue—we had politely inquired about the membership process, yet the staff failed to provide clear guidance and responded with a poor attitude. The female staff member even dismissed us by saying, ""I don’t know what you’re talking about,"" and walked away.

To prove that we had not been unreasonable or disrespectful, we strongly requested to review the CCTV footage. Eventually, the male staff member helped us resolve the membership points issue, but neither he nor the female staff member offered an apology for their unprofessional service and poor attitude.

As a paying customer, I believe we deserve basic respect and proper service.

The food is absolutely delicious – the Korean fried chicken is crispy, flavorful, and perfectly seasoned. I highly recommend trying their signature Red Pepper Whole Chicken, they’re simply mouthwatering.

Not to forget the must have radish and seaweed soup to complete your meal! The portions are generous too, making it great value for the quality of food.

The service was exceptional. The staff were friendly, attentive, and made sure we had everything we needed without being intrusive. It really added to the overall positive experience.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is cozy and welcoming, with a modern yet comfortable vibe, perfect for a casual meal or a gathering with friends. The interior is well-designed, and you can tell they put a lot of thought into creating a relaxing dining environment.

Cake was bit bland , dry and very mild taste of pandan also no kick for the gula melaka - 2 months ago | (4⭐) It was terrible when I just tried it at very first time in City Square, JB in 2007, and forget about the outlets in Klang Valley, it was worst. BUT until few years back, when it started opened in Mid Valley, Pavilion Bukit Bintang and now in Sunway Pyramid, it has improved and changed with 360 degree with better taste, texture, more innovative and in trend. But my sister in Singapore is still complaining for the taste in Singapore. Anyway, well done and keep up the good work!

Used once in May 2024 and by the second time using in October 2024, the inside strap snapped. Poor sewing quality. Contact the outlet, and they said they don't provide any warranty nor any repair and asked to seek an outside luggage repair shop to fix it.

It is only second usage, and moreover, only 6 months from purchase.

Won't make any more purchases with this shop. - 3 months ago | (5⭐) Mr.Iskandar was very professional and provided great detailed explanations on differences between different materials of luggages and recommend based on my needs.

The sales guy clearly stated that 30% discount will be given when two item is bought, however, it was found on the receipt that only 20% was given. I called back to the shop and they said that they charged the price wrongly and ask us to go back to the shop immediately to get back our money. No compensation was given but causing more and more problems and inconvenience to customers. I’m not satisfied with the service so I’ve asked for a refund as I wanted to return the product back. This option is rejected and it shows how bad the service of this brand and how unprofessional this brand is as they did not train their employees well to prevent such things from happening. It also shows how bad the brand is as it’s after sales service is too bad. Besides, it’s already 2 weeks time and they have not processed the refund. - 6 months ago | (5⭐) Had a fabulous experience this morning. I stopped in looking for a wallet for my dad. There were two sales associates at the shop and both were super helpful and patient with me, especially the male associate who was helping me specifically (sorry didn’t catch your name!). I was trying to choose between two wallets with very different price points and they did not try to push me to the more expensive one. In fact the male associate actually pointed at the cheaper one saying the design of it would probably be more to the liking of an older gentleman. The display wallet was the last one so they couldn’t give me a new one, but polished the display one up for me, and also let me know that they offered lifetime polishing for the particular brand of wallet that I purchased, Charles Berkeley, my dad just needed to stop by any Leather Avenue outlet.

Limapulo by Baba Can Cook, was founded by the late John Tan Kim Chye (affectionately
known as Uncle John) and Alan Yun in 2014. Uncle John, a Baba, was the eldest son and
guardian of his family recipes. This is unusual as the kitchen was the domain of the
Nyonyas.
Alan and Uncle John both believe that the best way to preserve Peranakan heritage recipes
is by sharing them with the world.
Peranakan cuisine is a marriage of Hokkien flavours of soy and bean paste with the Malay
flavours of spice, coconut and tamarind. Dishes are labour intensive and elaborate, an
indicator of the wealth of the Peranakans.",G1.PT.05 & 06 (Ground Floor),"(5⭐) Very large.

We walked around this huge n complex shopping mall cos there were so many different exits n entrances. It was like a maze n you can easily lose your direction n get lost. We bought a couple of snacks n then on the ground floor we saw a large crowd queuing up outside a shop. Being curious n feeling kiasu, we went over to have a look. Wow it was Luckin Coffee the popular n famous brand of coffee from China. But why the large crowd? We discovered that they were having a promotion. Only RM 2.99 per cup of coffee of your choice from their menu. They offer a wide variety of coffees which range from RM 10 _ RM 15. So cheap n highly affordable. So we also joined the queue. The workers worked very fast n were very efficient in preparing the coffee. We didn't need to wait long before we got our coffee. They were very orderly n systematic in their operation too. First we had to scan the QR code n then download the app n then register n then choose your coffee n then you make your payment. Finally just wait for your order n then collect your coffee from the main counter. Everything went very smoothly n fast n without any mistakes at all. Wonderful experience for us all to see n watch how this China system worked. - 2 weeks ago | (4⭐) During the launch week, I happened to visit Sunway and was able to use the offer rate to get a drink and handle the queue.

The staff then just pass me some tissue to let me clean myself and the mess. After that, i thought the staff is going to give me another cone as their apology, since i dun even touch the ice cream yet, but no, i was paying for a dropped ice cream which i think it's not even my careless to drop it...

It was around 5pm at that time, so the cafe was not that busy as it was past tea time for most of the shoppers. So the tables n chairs around this cafe were almost empty except for one or two customers buying some drinks. Anyway , the shelves where  all the pastries n cakes were displayed , were almost empty. So many of their pastries were already sold out. There were a wide range of different types of drinks such as coffee n drinks on sale. Browsing through the pastries, I chose to buy some pastries to take back home as breakfast the next morning. What I bought was some pastries such as 3 croissants, 2 fruit tarts n 4 slices of cheese cakes, lemon cakes n some slices of fruit cakes. - 3 weeks ago | (5⭐) 📍Located on the west side of Sunway G floor, next to Bobbie Brown.

🍰Coffee Basque cheesecake is really good.
Delicious! Very smooth creamy taste, the wet paste I like! No need to chew, it melts in your mouth~ The coffee flavor is super strong, plus enough cream cheese, it's delicious! The sweetness is just right. Recommended!

☕️Hot latte was ok.

🌲environment：
The dining area is quite large. The seats are retro and comfortable.

The staffs were busy with their own work. If you need anything, just go ask, they would love to help.

🎬2025.2.1 - a month ago | (3⭐) So happy that Lizzie is now in Sunway Pyramid! 🙌 A sister cafe of Lisette's, it offers an extensive array of pastries and cakes, as well as grab & go meals. A 10% discount is applicable to Sunway students and employees too.

Currently an opening promotion is going on which you can redeem a free coffee by any purchase of 2 items! 🌟

Ordered:
Pandan Gula Melaka Cake 🍰 (RM17)
Looks visually appealing, but the taste was really meh; it had a super strong pandan fragrance which overpowered the cake ☹️ the texture was also dry, seemed like it may have been refrigerated overnight so it didn't taste as ""fresh"" so there's a mushy mouthfeel. Honestly, could have opted for other cakes instead within a similar price range.

Crookie 🥐 (RM13)
Lizzie's best seller - croissant and soft cookie in one with a thin layer of chocolate spread inside! Not mindblowing, but the standpoint was the croissant, which retained its flakiness throughout; texture isn't soggy too 👍 Not a must try, but it's worth trying if you would like to have a dessert-pastry fusion!

Iced Latte ☕️⭐️ (RM13)
Got this for free as a promotion! Serving cup is bigger than most cafes I have been to so honestly this is reasonable according to price point 😬

Personally visited the first outlet in NU Sentral and my experience was better, probably due to the items I have personally tried. Ambiance wise, the interior is more spacious than the current outlet, plus it's also easier to find seats compared to the current one.

Though Lizzie has both hits and misses, I might return to this outlet again (maybe) to try out some other pastries. - a month ago | (2⭐) Besides the nice setup here, I've nothing much to say about this cafe. Their ongoing promo ""free 1 coffee with purchase of two items"" is misleading, and only limited to food. Anyways the staff aren't very sharp or attentive, and the service was so slow. We only ordered 3 drinks no food, considering that we were the only customers.
My dirty matcha latte was so-so, and overpriced for the quality. - a month ago | (5⭐) Wide selection of quality pastries, cake and meal boxes. Coffee is very good compared to many grab & go places.

Was pierced by Ross, who made me feel comfortable throughout - the whole thing was super quick and painless! It's been a week now and following the aftercare advice my ears are healing nicely with no swelling and minimal pain.
I've been to other Lovisa branches and honestly I am usually skeptical of the staff's skills but this Sunway Pyramid branch proved me wrong, they are professional, friendly and helpful.

Excellent coffee with a unique flavor where it is fused with Pandan leaves.

Do remember to ask for your preferred level of sweetness.

Good place to sit and watch the world breeze by. - 3 months ago | (4⭐) Visited during the opening.

Ordered a Claypot Thai Milk Coffee.

Was so looking forward to an ""immersive tasting experience"". Unfortunately, none at all! Neither was there any touted ""exotic aroma"" nor ""intricate flavours"". Coffee was mediocre -- lacked strength and richness. Disappointed!

Also ordered Pak Lung's Roti Bakar. Pandan was good - smooth, rich, creamy and fragrant. But roti bakar was squashed as if someone had squeezed it and wasn't well toasted.

Nevertheless, splendid location with good vantage point to watch the world go by. Good pitstop to take a break from shopping. - 2 months ago | (4⭐) The aroma is very nice when you are near the shop.
I like their menu choices, habe tried the thai milk tea and butterfly pea milk. Both refreshing and smells very nice.
Only downside is that its way too sweet for me. - 2 months ago | (5⭐) Located at LG2, beside the escalator near Bungkus Kaw Kaw..

The atmosphere is great and comfy.. eventhough there is only 7 table at this shop.. to stop and take a stop is great here.. have your coffee or teatime here..

Currently the menu that i LOVE is Claypot Thai Tea Milk, Claypot Thai Tea Coffee, Claypot Thai Cocoa, Claypot Thai Horkasai, Thai Lemon Tea and Last But Not Least Thai Claypot Thai Green Milk Tea.. The Price is reasonable to upgrade only Add On RM1.. The packaging itself is nice and engaging..

Staff is friendly and great.. very helpful and help customer to guide what is their signature drink.. overall happy with this drink..

Recommended to try here in LUNG NGEN Thai Claypot Coffee.. ☕️🍵

Just come here again.. as usual the service is topnotch.. :) - 4 weeks ago | (5⭐) Honestly one of the good (not too sweet) tea or coffee if you like it Thai Style.

Previously I did buy some walnuts, cashew nuts n peanuts but my family members have eaten them all already. Since I was shopping in Sunway Pyramid, I walked into this store n was amazed by the huge varieties of different types of snacks, nuts , biscuits , chips n candies n jellies on sale. All these were packed n sealed in attractive n easy to carry packages. There were healthy snacks, instant vegetable snacks,children’s snacks, candy n jelly n various nuts n drinks- all imported from China. As for the bottled drinks, they were selling sugar cane juice, lime juice n orange juice. As for the nuts, if you buy one big packet of assorted nuts , you will get another packet free of charge. These were all beautifully gift wrapped .  So I browsed around the shelves n bought some packets of mixed nuts n healthy snacks . - 3 weeks ago | (5⭐) Took over Yubiso store....strategic location in Sunway Pyramid, become my frequent visited store. I like here because they have few good ready-make frozen seafoods dishes ( actually from local 5* restaurants and all info.written in Chinese words only )available here.

The store is well-organized, making it easy to browse the options. However, the customer service could use some improvement as staff members weren't very attentive during my visit. Prices are on the higher side, which may not suit all budgets. While the quality of the products is satisfactory, the overall shopping experience didn't stand out.

I was expecting tough beef but it was nice & tender & piping hot. Coffee was nice to complete the meal. Good crowd helped me decide where to eat. - 3 months ago | (4⭐) This is my second time dining at this outlet, and the food here continues to be the best compared to all the other outlets. We had dumpling soup, glass noodles with soft shell crab and otak-otak fried rice.

The dumpling soup is a delightful blend of flavours and textures. The minced prawn and chicken filling in the dumplings is succulent and well seasoned, providing a savoury bite with each spoonful. The broth is light yet flavourful, perfectly complementing the dumplings.

The claypot glass noodles with soft shell crab is a dish that truly standout. The glass noodles are stir fried in dark soy sauce, giving them a rich and umami flavour. The highlight, of course, is the soft shell crab, which is cooked to perfection. The crab is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, adding a delightful crunch to the dish. The combination of textures and flavours makes this a must try.

Lastly, the otak-otak fried rice is a unique and flavourful dish. The rice is perfectly cooked and infused with the distinct taste of otak-otak, a special fish cake. The dish is well balanced and not overly spicy, making it enjoyable for a wide range of palates. It’s a creative twist on traditional fried rice that is sure to impress. - 3 weeks ago | (5⭐) You must dine at Madam Kwan’s at Sunway Pyramid. The Satay is the best i have tasted in my lifetime! Madam Kwan has perfected her Satay with the juiciest and perfect satay marinade and the satay sauce is also the best in terms of taste and consistency. Madam Kwan’s Salted Fish Fried Rice is to die for. Its very rich in flavour, moist and the bits of salted fish is so crunchy and they do not stinge on it. There are even toppings of ikan bilis. We just had to order a second plate of the Salted Fish Fried Rice ! The Nasi Bojari is also the best so far. These dishes were recommended by their staff Ika who is very  friendly and her customer service is unparalleled!  We ended our meal with another recommendation by Ika - Fritters with Ice Cream. The batter was just right, light and tasty and the banana wasn’t sweet and was complimented very well with the vanilla ice cream. Well done Madam Kwan ! - 2 months ago | (5⭐) I can't lie about Madan Kwan's food—it's excellent as usual. I have nothing to complain about regarding the food; however, it was my first time visiting the Sunway Pyramid branch over the weekend, and the service was not as expected. It was much worse than I anticipated. I had to call the staff for everything, including utensils, plates, and even coffee, which was served with out sugar!

After the foreign worker asked me for the pin, he asked me, ""Sampai bila?"" I was confused by his question and thought he was asking about the expiry or last collection date. So, I showed him my phone, but he started checking all the previous messages. I reminded him that the other parcels mentioned in the previous messages had already been collected and that he only needed to check the last message.

He spoke to me in an unfriendly manner and asked, ""Parcel bila sampai?"" That was when I finally understood his question. I informed him that the parcel had just arrived today. However, at the end, he said to me in a blaming tone, ""Lain kali bagi tahu parcel bila sampai, sini parcel banyak.""

Another staff member (Kakak with glasses) kindly explained to me that, because they have so many parcels, they usually categorize them by the received date.

I understand the workload, but I must say this:

Normally, I drop my parcels at the Mentari branch, but since that branch was full, I decided to use this branch instead. However, I will never drop my parcels here again.

It's colorful and pretty looking. That's what gets me all the time. What's more, it's Manuka Honey and not the pure sugar that is making it sweet. My choice of the Immune Booster was just nice with the sweetness level. Not that I'm hoping that my immune systems will get a boost from this, I'm not naive. But the drinks do suit my taste buds. - a year ago | (5⭐) As a fan of health-conscious beverages, I recently tried Manuka honey drink, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations in both taste and nutritional benefits.

Firstly, let's talk about the flavor. Manuka honey drink offers a delightful blend of sweetness from the honey with a subtle hint of earthiness. The richness of the honey provides a comforting warmth to each sip, making it a truly enjoyable experience.

Beyond its taste, the health benefits of Manuka honey are well-documented. Renowned for its antibacterial properties, Manuka honey is believed to support immune health and promote overall well-being. Knowing that each sip of this delicious beverage may contribute to my health gives me even more reason to indulge.

What I appreciate most about Manuka honey drink is its versatility. Whether enjoyed hot as a soothing beverage on a chilly day or chilled for a refreshing pick-me-up, it never fails to satisfy my cravings for something both healthy and delicious.

In conclusion, Manuka honey drink has earned its place as a staple in my beverage repertoire. Its delectable flavor and potential health benefits make it a standout choice for anyone looking to elevate their drinking experience. I highly recommend giving it a try – your taste buds and your body will thank you. - 11 months ago | (5⭐) Just nice packing and very gentle staff.

Please improve, this is unacceptable given the volume of orders. - 4 months ago | (1⭐) 😭 Disappointing Experience at Mixue Sunway Pyramid Branch ❌❌❌

As a loyal customer of Mixue, I am deeply disappointed with the experience I had at the Sunway Pyramid branch recently. Here's what happened:

I purchased two beverages – Lemonade and Lemon Jasmine Tea – with no special requests, expecting the usual quality that Mixue is known for. However, when I shared the drinks with my friend after about 15 minutes, we were shocked to find that both beverages were completely tasteless, akin to plain water. This was far from the consistent flavor we’ve come to expect as regular customers.

Hoping to resolve the issue, I rushed back to the shop (within 25 minutes of purchase) despite knowing they were about to close. I politely explained the situation to two Malay staffs, stating that both drinks lacked flavor and requested an exchange. To my surprise, one of the staff members simply added sugar to one of the drinks and handed it back to me, insisting that this was the solution.

This approach was unacceptable for multiple reasons:
1. The ice had already melted, and the original flavors were beyond repair.
2. The staff dismissed my feedback and offered no meaningful resolution.
3. When I requested a refund or a fresh replacement, they outright refused, claiming it was not possible since they were closing.

When I asked for an explanation, I was told the drinks were prepared according to SOP, and the company had implemented a new policy of using only 25% sugar. However, this explanation doesn’t justify the complete lack of taste in the drinks, as even the Jasmine Tea didn’t have its usual flavor.

What frustrated me most was the staff's refusal to acknowledge any mistake. They even stated they couldn’t taste-test the beverages themselves, leaving me with no choice but to leave the drinks and receipt at the counter in frustration.

This experience reflects poorly on Mixue's quality control, customer service, and refund policy. For a brand operating in a prestigious mall like Sunway Pyramid, such an unprofessional response is disappointing. I don’t believe this is how a company aiming for growth and expansion should handle loyal customers’ concerns.

To summarize:
- Both drinks lacked flavor and quality.
- The staff’s response was dismissive and unhelpful.
- No proper resolution, exchange, or refund was provided.

The menu offered a variety of fresh soy-based snacks and beverages, perfect for a quick, healthy treat. I tried their signature soymilk, which was delicious and freshly prepared.

We ordered:
☑️ Ginger soup Tau Fu fah —  mild spicy ginger kick. Taro balls are chewy. Recommend for ginger lovers.
☑️ Original soy ice cream — prominent soy bean flavor which I loved. Recommend!
☑️ Chocolate Japanese Obanyaki Pancake — chocolate flavor is jot too strong. Tastes like what you would expect.

I ordered a soya bean curd with taro ball add-on, which cost RM3 extra, but it only came with 4 mini taro balls. This was shocking, so I questioned the cashier. They added 2 more mini taro balls, but it still felt like very poor value for money.

Additionally, the soya bean curd itself lacked the rich, authentic soya taste I was expecting. It was bland and did not meet the standard I’ve experienced at other similar shops.

Overall, this was not a good experience for the price I paid, and I hope the shop can improve its quality and portion sizes. - 3 months ago | (4⭐) No, this Mr Bean has nothing to do with Mr Bean the classic comedy series. Yes, it is yet another dessert chain outlet that serves overpriced artisan Tau Fu Fah.

I've nothing against such outlets as it is good that the traditional dessert is enjoying a sudden resurgence of late. However, Tau Fu Fah is a rather simple dessert and I've always found it difficult to swallow the sky-high prices.

Prices aside, the Tau Fu Fah here is smooth and creamy, just the way I like it. It is nice that customers have options on the type of sugar and the sugar level but on the other hand be prepared to pay up to RM2 more for some of the sugar options. Ironically, you don't get a discount if you opt for just 25% sugar level.

Besides the soya items, they also serve Japanese Pancakes with a variety of both sweet and savory fillings. These are pretty good but also pretty pricey. - a month ago | (4⭐) the pancake is a bit dry, filling is very less and only the dough is thick. for the dessert is decent - 2 months ago",Mr Bean - Sunway Pyramid,N/A,"Monday: 9:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Tuesday: 9:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Wednesday: 9:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Thursday: 9:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Friday: 9:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Saturday: 9:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Sunday: 9:00 AM – 10:00 PM"

Yet another Thai restaurant I visited in search of the perfect Mango sticky rice pudding. Before that we ordered the Pineapple rice served in a pineapple, Laksa, Chicken wings, a set meal and fried rice. The sticky rice was so sticky we needed a knife to cut it through, the coconut milk was too salty, the Laksa had an underwhelming flavour but the show stealers were the green chilli sauce that was the condiment on the table and minced chicken that came with the set meal. We were served a drink with the set meal that had an aftertaste of cough syrup. I still gave it 3 stars for food because the mango was nice and the fried rice and the pineapple rice were enjoyed by my friends. The chicken was described to be juicy and tender. - 2 months ago | (4⭐) I ordered the Thai Laksa coz I was curious as to how it tastes like. It tasted amazing! It is like an enhanced version of the northern asam laksa. Really tasty.

However, the portion that came was really, really small. I spoke to the waitress about it, saying that it’s really small for the price charged. Without question asked, she came back with more noodles for me. Great service!

Curious about why would anyone purchase insoles, he began to journey to understand more on shoes and leg pain problems. During abroad, he obtained the principle of bio-dynamics, helping him to further understand insoles and their purpose. He began trying different insoles on himself.
After 6 months, he realized that his own knee problems have improved. Since then, he decided to venture into the making of insole business – MyFeet. He imported digital scanning machines from Korea to analyse customers feet problems and custom made insoles that solve their feet problems. After many years of analysing, feet problems can be categorized into a flat arch, high arch, bowleg, knock knee, overpronation, and supination. These problems will lead to an imbalance of body biodynamics, causing stress on the rest of the body such as foot pain, knee pain, and back pain.
Mr. Wong created MyFeet to help more people to solve pains caused by the feet. The sandals in MyFeet Sunway Pyramid are carefully engineered using the finest materials like high-grade memory foam, shaped and moulded to fit each wearer feet condition.

I asked her for my size, which one got stock she just pointed but we saw there was another design of the size we needed on display so took and put on.. asked her can we have that... she just answered rudely ""I told u no stock, that is display!"".. we tried to be patient and ask so which got stock? She again answered rudely ""I told you already only this design""... so we asked which one? She just kept saying ""I told u already!!""... so we asked her, can't you just tell properly and at least let us try since u already have limited stocks.. she still continued to mumble ""I already told you!""

tend to open up after a few months, I even got 2 pairs that broke into 2. As I always buy and keep a spare pair of sandals, recently I wore the new pair, after walking at the shopping complex for 2 hrs, the base came off. Omg I had to slowly inch my way to the car park to change to another pair of sandals.
The outlet in Sunway Pyramid says they don't repair anymore. I took to the roadside cobbler, he told me MyFeet sandals he can't glue as he has experience glueing them and a week later customer brought back to him after it came off again.
Now I don't know where to send for repairs as this is a new sandals that cost RM299. I hope MyFeet can advise.

Straight to the point we ordered their famous wanton noodles and butter buns and they were out of this world.

Their other food items like we ordered such as Luncheon meat noodles and rice , and yam bun were okay at best but still acceptable as they tasted very fresh and weren't too salty which means the limited usage of MSG which is a positive in my books 👍🏻

However, the reason why I'm rating it a 4 star is the delay of the food arrival as I understand there are a lot of customers but the kitchen staff should combat this and push dishes out quicker.

Environment wise, the cafe is very clean and has a vibrant decor which makes it welcoming for potential customers. There is an open window area on the side for people to look outside and embrace the nature where you can even see Sunway University in the distance.

This place looks great and the food tastes great. The staff are very attentive to your order and will even clear your plates when you’re done. The noodles’ texture is sparingly and slightly chewy.

This service is the worst service you can imagine, it's literally STEALING from customers! HOW can clients be charged so much for such poor service!
I asked for a basic manicure for 48RM, I was far from imagining that this only included nail trimming, no foot soaking, no cleaning, no filing of heels! absolutely nothing, just cut nails, file nails! when I asked the lady who did the pedicure if my feet should not be filed and if it was included in the pedicure, she told me yes but that my heels are hard, so she recommends the medical pedicure (88 RM) rather than the basic one! I thought it would be better, it was worse! She attacked the skin on my feet without wetting them or cleaning them, she just put a tiny bit of emollient product for the heels which she left on for less than 2 minutes, that's all, and she removed the calluses using a special blade. No scrub, no wash, no mask, no massage, no filing, in 15-20 minutes everything was finished and the cashier charged me for 2 pedicures! I paid for 136 RM for just cutting my nails, buffing them a little bit and cutting the callus wich is a scandal! It’s not about money, it’s a question of principles, and it was extremely disappointing!
And by the way : zero hygiene, zero professionalism, zero service, zero skills. - 2 weeks ago | (5⭐) Fantastic nail service

The cosmetics line began with twelve lipsticks sold at Barneys New York. Since then, NARS has created various multi-use beauty products and now is a subsidiary of Shiseido. After the falling out in the contract with YSL, Shiseido's investment upon merging with NARS in research and development led to the wide range or products for both Females and Males. The company's aim is to create products that suit all genders without discrimination. Evident in the recent collections of palettes, the main darker shades centered around Blue, Gray etc represent the compatibility with males. After taking on YouTuber Jeffree Star's comments on unity in strength amongst all genders, NARS Cosmetics decided to expand their horizon in various designs and color schemes to accommodate all people of color, shapes and sizes who are expressing themselves through makeup. Nars is no longer a cruelty free brand. In 2017 NARS announced that, despite being against animal testing, it was a requirement for selling products in the China market. In a public statement the company said: ""We have decided to make NARS available in China because we feel it is important to bring our vision of beauty and artistry to fans in the region.

Recommended! - 2 years ago | (5⭐) Enjoyed my experience with Anis here. She is very professional and patient in assisting me on my bra selection and sizing. Very good service. Well done! - 2 years ago | (5⭐) 10/10 service
(This is coming from a person who has worn the wrong size and didn't know how to wear a bra properly for the past 5-6 years)

The bra's are expensive but it's definitely worth the service that they give you.
For the first time in my life, the people working there wasn't like. ""Aunty see, Aunty know.""
When I say body positivity, this is the place for that.
They don't mention anything about your size, or how big or small your bust size or cup is. No word about it at all. As it should be.

I've struggled finding the right size that was comfortable for me and my chest. Yes, the ladies might be invasive and touching those places but they point things out to me that I have never noticed before since no one told me. Especially showing me how to wear a bra properly, literally hands on me.

For the first time in my life, I feel more confident in my body - especially my breast. There is nothing wrong with small or large breast, we are all special in our own way :)

If you struggle to find a size perfect for you and need the service that helps you feel confident in yourself (even just a little) come here.

Concept is very much similar to Hooga so i guess the more the competition, the better for us consumers. Their range is not as diversed as Hooga, but they do have some interesting stuff on display. Pricing is a little more on the high side, but overall its still quite ok. - 3 years ago | (4⭐) Exceptionally affordable pricing for homeware, kitchenware and tableware (hardly anything over $30aud!!!)🤯😱

My haul was substantial due to the crazy good deals to be had🤭, and they were very accommodating, wrapping each piece of flatware, as well as allowed me to inspect the tea box before finalising my purchase.

I'd say Objet is the Malaysian equivalent to Kmart here in Sydney. Good value, not the highest quality items but still worth it - For example, the tea box I bought had a knob that I needed to buy the correct screw for, in order for it to sit securely on the lid and thus be functional. Not a deal breaker for me, but would be annoying for those not into figuring out a surprise DIY project 😅🛠 would return nonetheless!

1888 was the year Obermain began creating quality shoes and boots in Burgkunstadt, a town on the Upper Main River whose leather goods were sought by elite professionals in turn of the century Germany. Burgkunstadt’s legacy of craftsmanship and material excellence lives on today – in shoes, bags, and accessories designed by Obermain to continue our proud tradition.
Obermain invites men and women to step into a new kind of comfort, the kind that overcomes outdated compromises that pit form versus function, wearability versus appeal, and tradition versus modernity. Where quality workmanship and materials assure durability. Where special comfort features make every step – leisurely on brisk, on carpet or concrete – lighter, softer, more flexible, and more secure. Where style means a contemporary touch and updated details that set you at ease weekdays and weekends. The perfect union of quality, comfort, and style. Obermain is made for striding with confidence through every walk of life.
We design our products to be loved and used for a long time. We may apply classic silhouettes or re-interpret them with a twist. If we do this, we must keep the shoe silhouette recognizable. We are not slaves to fashion, yet we may adapt trends as touches of modernity—subtly and tastefully.

The green tea is particularly impressive, flavorful, and worth the price. Although the spaghetti is on the pricier side, it’s worth it, with fresh prawns cooked perfectly. We also tried the big breakfast, and while the sausage was surprisingly deep-fried instead of pan-fried, it was still tasty. The salad was fresh and enjoyable. Overall, the food quality justifies the prices, making it a nice spot to visit for a satisfying meal. - 2 months ago | (3⭐) Overall, I think this place has potential, but it's not quite there yet.

We ordered tea and dessert, which tastes really good and reasonable to the pricing. However, management needs to put in the time to train their employees to elevate the place.

I looked at the menu and saw so many different types of teas. This is for people who are willing to pay the money to try out nuances between different types of teas.
The place presents itself as a more sophisticated place, not just your regular cafe. So, I asked the waitress for recommendations.

To my disappointment, the waitresses there were clearly part-timers hired to only serve tables. They also didn't have a person dedicated to recommend teas or talk about why is it brewed a certain way.

This should have been the selling point of the place-- yet it is not fully utilized.

From this experience, it goes from a potential spot for tea lovers who want to try different types of teas-- to suddenly just a regular cafe.

To be honest, the staff were polite, I find no fault in the service itself. I just can tell that no further training was given for them -- or 1 dedicated person -- to make the experience better. Again, I wouldn't write this much if it's just a regular cafe.

I can see that there is potential, and I can tell what the initial vision was.  I hope to see the place improve over time, or, to accept the route of being a regular cafe, where customers will start to ask about the price versus what you're getting. Just food for thought! - a month ago | (3⭐) The price vs environment doesn't match. It is a tad pricey for the food portion and serving doesn't come together if you come in group. Personally I find it awkward that I have to sit at the outside and it is so noisyto chill. The dessert is nice and matched with the price. Overall is alright but with such price, repeat visit is less - 2 months ago | (3⭐) The chazuke at OGA is really nice and stands out as the highlight of the menu. However, the restaurant has very limited space, making it feel a bit cramped during busy hours. Desserts are popular and tend to sell out quickly, which can be disappointing if you arrive late. While the food quality is ok, the prices are quite high, and I feel they might not fully justify the overall experience. A decent spot, but there’s room for improvement. - 3 months ago | (3⭐) Overall, the food looks good but the taste could be improved. The dashi for the ochazuke is not hot enough. It was served just slightly warm. The houjicha burnt cheese cake was not as strong as I'd like it to be, and it is pricey for the price.

This place serves a nice one. It is crispy skin, with the nicely tasty seasoned base. And most important, the meat doesn’t have the after taste or frozen meat smell!

You can see we even ordered extra siew yok to savour again! - a month ago | (1⭐) 1.  Spaghetti (Bolognese)
- The sauce appears watery, pooling around the edges of the plate, which indicates poor consistency.
- The sauce-to-spaghetti ratio seems off, with an excess of liquid making the dish look less appetizing.

2. Chicken Chop with Fries and Coleslaw
- The chicken chop looks over-sauced, which might result in a soggy texture, especially if it's fried.
- The sauce consistency appears thin and overly glossy, which might make the dish feel greasy.
- Fries seem undercooked or lacking a crispy appearance, making them look unap

3. Iced Drink - Ribena Longan
- The iced drink has a murky appearance, which could be due to uneven mixing or dilution from melted ice.
- The lemon slice is visible but seems more like an afterthought rather than a deliberate garnish.

Our dining experience was further diminished by poor service. When we arrived, the waiter insisted on showing us to a smaller table, despite us expressing our preference for a larger one. While we understand that some larger tables were reserved, the staff made no effort to check for other unreserved options that could have accommodated us comfortably. This lack of initiative and effort left a poor impression and made us feel like an inconvenience rather than valued customers. - 4 months ago | (5⭐) Came here for a quick lunch. Food portion were quite big and arrived quickly. Overall an enjoyable experience. Recommended - a month ago | (5⭐) My fav spot to yumcha with friends and family. Very relaxing & comfortable atmosphere and most importantly the air conditioning in this area is NOTICEABLY MORE COOLER. ( Iykyk) Their prices are also pretty reasonable compared to other spots in the mall. You get good quality without feeling like you’re overpaying. The drinks here are also pretty good. Both the coffee and teh beng are smooth and taste great without being too strong or overly sweet.
Will definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a place to unwind at Sunway Pyramid!

Business Hours: 11am-11pm",G1.136 (Ground Floor),"(5⭐) As a plant-based diner, finding a satisfying meal at a predominantly meat-centric restaurant can be a challenge, but Ole Ole Bali at Sunway Pyramid pleasantly surprised us with its thoughtful vegetarian options.

During a recent lunch treat by my boss, I opted for the Grilled Vege Ciabatta, a delightful combination of chargrilled vegetables nestled in a warm, crusty ciabatta. The flavors were well-balanced, and the fresh ingredients made for a hearty and satisfying bite. Accompanying my meal was the Lemongrass Mojito, an incredibly refreshing drink that was the perfect antidote to the sweltering afternoon heat. The vibrant mix of lemongrass and mint was both cooling and invigorating—highly recommended for those looking for a non-alcoholic thirst-quencher.

While my colleagues enjoyed their respective meals, I truly appreciated the effort put into crafting a flavorful and well-prepared plant-based option. Ole Ole Bali may not be a fully vegetarian restaurant, but it certainly caters to those seeking fresh, wholesome, and delicious plant-based alternatives.

Here are some pictures of our meals—because good food deserves to be shared! - in the last week | (4⭐) Excellent ambience. Makes you feel you are in Bali more than Malaysia. Food presentation is good & food is served relatively quickly. The portion is huge and more than adequate for two persons to share. Only the grilled chicken seems a bit tough. Would have been better if they had used fresh chicken. - 2 months ago | (3⭐) 2nd visit to this chain restaurant.

Personally the dishes aren't quite my taste, everything seems a bit bland or not much flavor n  too oily for me either grilled or fried dish.

The same side dish is served at every rice set dish.

Chicken chop looks a bit over fried, it is a bit too dry.

Grill chicken is very oily.

Original serving of the pulut hita drink is too sweet... Should request for less sugar.

Somehow the food presentation is awesome.

Everyone has got different expectations n preferences on food taste.

The management has a great way of promoting the restaurant with a free birthday meal...... - 2 months ago | (5⭐) Big portion. We only ordered 2 mains and a dessert, and left the place full! Delicious grilled chicken and nasi campur. The pisang bakar dessert was outstanding as well. The wait can be a little long. - 2 months ago | (5⭐) Loved this restaurant! It has a stunning Bali vibe, and the decor is simply amazing, perfectly complementing the Indo-Bali cuisine. It was our first visit, as we came to celebrate a birthday. All the dishes were great, the Tipat Cantuk stood out as my favorite.

Visited on a weekday around 7pm and waited about 20 minutes in front of the restaurant after receiving a waiting number.

She appeared to be in her 40s and was quite rude, often rolling her eyes and speaking in a very harsh manner. Her communication with customers was poor, lacking politeness and respect. To make matters worse, she made inappropriate comments, even body-shaming customers.

Although the dresses sold here are beautiful and reasonably priced between RM100-250, I decided not to make a purchase because of this sales assistant's rude behavior. She didn’t smile, was unprofessional, and her attitude completely ruined the shopping experience. Credit to the owner for offering such lovely products, but I suggest ensuring that staff have better attitudes to avoid driving customers away. - 4 months ago | (5⭐) The shopkeeper was very good at picking dresses for me to try according to my company annual dinner theme: masquerade night. I was quite worried that I can't fit the dress because I am quite plump. However, the dress fit perfectly without any alteration and showing my waistline, making me look slim. The dress is within my budget too.

Rain, the shop assistant, proved to be a true asset with her exceptional service. She effortlessly guided us to the nicest dresses, and we ended up purchasing three, finding them worth every penny. The next day, when I wanted to exchange a dress for a lighter color, Rain's fashion expertise shone through as she suggested unique patterns I hadn't considered. This shop not only offers adorable designs at reasonable prices but is elevated by Rain's professionalism and genuine understanding of customers' needs. It has become my go-to destination for stylish attire, and Rain is undoubtedly the gem that makes the shopping experience truly remarkable. Highly recommended for those seeking quality and personalized service. - a year ago | (4⭐) I went there to buy a dress yesterday and I honestly enjoyed it. Even though the sales lady was quite rushed, she will still ask you whether what type of dresses you are looking for?

During an initial visit, I tried on many different pairs and was attended to by Nelson, who politely and calmly helped me with my choices. But, I didn't get anything, thinking that I should look around first.

However, I didn't receive the same treatment elsewhere, even though I found something I really liked. And because of that, I went back to Oopa to get two pairs because of the service level.

There is always a queue to get in and it is worth the wait. Today I tried Malay Fried Rice, Egg Tart and Cincau Cold. It was tasty and refreshing. - a month ago | (4⭐) This restaurant has a pretty long cue when we arrive. That’s just natural given how popular and the reputation it has among the locals like myself. I only visited their branch in KLIA but not the one here.

So when my family arrived at this branch this morning, there was a pretty long cue. But what I admire most was how quick their staff got their act together in ensuring each waiting customer gets welcome and directed to their seats while not getting them to wait too long. I personally thought their service was pretty professional and efficient.

Their environment was pretty spot on as it gives off the classy kopitiam vibes.

Now, when it comes to their food & beverages. Their coffee is certainly not bad but is definitely not the best I’ve tried. Their famous Ipoh Hor Fun was rather bland and am not too sure why it’s much to shout about. I certainly have tried much better Ipoh Hor Fun out there. But don’t let that ruin your entire experience at this restaurant. The saving grace for me and is one of their must try dishes if you’re here is their Nasi Lemak and their Kaya & Butter Toast bun as well as their Oriental Polo Bun. Am glad that it wasn’t a completely letdown and negative experience.

It’s definitely a good place to have breakfast or tea time.

The deco and design is in Snow White theme overall quite nice 😊

We ordered Roman Feast set with RM398 excluded 16% tax...the food is still OK......wedges are crunchy....I love the creamy mushrooms soup....however the portion is so so and the set had 2 salad....which we think is not so worthy...included beverage each people only drink 1, and we had 6 people, we spent around RM110 per headcount....which the price might just eat 1 piece pizza? 1 bowl mushrooms?

Having launched its ecommerce business in Singapore in 2017, the brand was known for its premium value gaming monitors that offered the best performance at wallet-friendly prices. Following its success in the gaming space, the brand then launched its own brand of Android TVs, which it is best known for today.

In 2021, PRISM+ brought its brand of direct-to-consumer ecommerce business model to Malaysia to great reception. The brand’s introduction of its 86” Android TV, the Q86 PRO-QE, shook the market for large screen TVs at never-before-seen prices. – and quickly became the top-selling Android TV and Monitor brands in e-commerce. Since then, the brand has moved from strength-to-strength and is now looking to venture beyond its ecommerce origins with its very first experiential store at Sunway Pyramid. Its store in Sunway Pyramid is the first of its kind outside of Singapore, which launched its first physical stores in August 2022, and sees the brand name Malaysia as a key market for its growth. Not forgetting its gaming roots, PRISM+ has also partnered with Logitech to offer gaming peripherals at its offline store, as part of its commitment in offering customers a holistic experience. The brand will continue to expand its offerings in Malaysia, with the Sunway Pyramid store serving as a physical touchpoint for its fans to experience its latest product launches. As the first physical store in Malaysia, PRISM+ at Sunway Pyramid is a signal of ambition from the fast-growing consumer electronics brand as it gears towards its next big move. In Singapore, the brand recently announced its first smart home appliance, the PRISM+ Zero, and has teased that it will move in the same direction in Malaysia – while continuing to offer the best deals for Android TVs, productivity, and gaming monitors and more.

Definitely will come back again when we need anything prom prism+ - 4 months ago | (1⭐) I am beyond frustrated with Prism+. They promised a simple one-on-one exchange process for warranty claims, but the reality was far from that. Instead of a straightforward exchange or repair, I was forced to jump through countless hoops and complete endless steps just to get any kind of response. After all of that, they didn’t even exchange or repair the defective product.

What makes this worse is that they don’t even have a service center to handle issues directly. It’s all just a frustrating online back-and-forth with no actual support. I regret purchasing from this company and would advise others to stay away unless you want to deal with endless delays and a complete lack of customer care. - 3 months ago | (2⭐) I bought a Google TV Q series in 2022 via PRISM online platform (it comes with 2 years warranty).Now - Nov 24, my TV is 2 years 10 months old, it starts having problem, blank (black) screen after power on. Spoke to customer support, since my TV is after warranty period (even though is only 10 months after warranty) the TV is less than 3 years old, they told me they cannot help and offer me a 15% discount if I choose to buy a new unit of TV.

Palsaik is the whole package in terms of the quality of their meats and their sides. I've never had a bad time going to Palsaik and always leave satisfied. The service is also excellent as servers are constantly nearby. They cook for you as well, and they do a good job at it, too. This particular branch is really nice as it's the most spacious I've seen. They also have a nice kids' room attached to the restaurant. Price-wise, it is on the high side compared to other Korean BBQ places. However, what you get for your money is worth well it! Definitely and highly recommended! - 4 months ago | (5⭐) Had a great meal here! There were three of us, and we went for their set for two—it was just the right amount. Also got the vegetable pancake, which was super crispy and delicious!

The staff were friendly and attentive, and the biggest win? We walked out not smelling like oil or smoky bbq. You know that scent that usually clings to your clothes after Korean BBQ? None of that here!

Oh, and the banchan were refillable, which is always a plus. Highly recommended! - in the last week | (5⭐) New dine in place in Sunway Pyramid. The interior design is nice and comfy, the staffs are friendly and helpful. It’s a cozy place for gathering and dine in. The is a playroom available for kid 3-12 years old too!

The taste of food is average according to my own preference. The menu did mention about the weight of the pork slice for 2 pax but personally think it’s small portion 😅 I definitely pork lover hence the portion is small for me.

Yummy yoghurt ice cream and it’s free flow, so with the bancan!

Overall happy with the dine in experience! One suggestion is if there is more choices for kid menu, that’s definitely perfect as it’s limited choice for toddler. - 2 months ago | (5⭐) First time invited by my friends in this place.. will be come again for bring my family due to play room provided for parents eating with peace.

Very uncomparation with other BBQ and hot pot restaurant perfect matching 2 in 1 set , affordable price and enjoying unlimited free desert ice cream with quality yoghurt ice cream free flow.. The pity of staff restaurant keeps refilling until the machine needs time to freeze ice cream. But lucky with display-hanging
""Notice preparation on progress."" Good practise every 5-7minutes. I still can enjoy the ice cream!

I also never expected free-flow side dishes/vegetables in here , Normally, we ask only to provide as normal restaurants practise.

Good to gain memory. At least, this is my future place for dine perfect combination. Never try, Never know.

Impressive in detailing informing customers service from time being, Even busy weekend still manageable but still feel provide services.

No choice. I've to become a regular guest here as a service provider, and alertness attention from the manager meets up my expectations.

As Mention enjoy peacefully, play room is temptation for me.. hehe.

Food is quite affordable price and has more choices for me in different varieties of BBQ, even Ala Carte.  Good space and large table suitable for family gatherings, so far this  place is the most plenty big table. But lucky do a reservation early.

Friendly and comfortable environment better than other restaurant I went before. Great recommended overall, but this is not a super fine dining restaurant expected but a friendly, caring, and comfortable restaurant as my thoughts. - 2 months ago | (5⭐) love the foods, services, and dining ambience. ordered mini palsaik set, including their signature 8 flavours pork belly. generous food portion v reasonable price and superb services. staff will BBQ the meat for customers and let u know when the meat is done. they will give advice or recommend based on the dishes u order. for example, we planned to order the fried rice but the fried rice taste not good if paired v the hot pot soup we had ordered, so the waitress gave us advise to change the fried rice we choose earlier. they provided free ais cream n free flow side dishes. if u don't want pork, they also served beef, chicken, and seafood for BBQ. there is a playroom for kids, bonus for them. - 3 months ago",Palsaik Korean BBQ - Sunway Pyramid,+60 3-5612 3303,"Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Tuesday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Wednesday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Thursday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Friday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Saturday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Sunday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM"

I ordered the Big Breakfast and upgraded the complimentary black coffee to a latte for an additional RM 5.00.

**Big Breakfast:**
- Taste: 9/10
- Portion: 5/10

The tomato was too large and not grilled for added flavor. It would have been better if it were served in smaller pieces. Additionally, there was only one small piece of bread.

The service was okay, though only one counter was open and card payment was unavailable. However, the food was brought to the table. - 2 months ago | (4⭐) Many choices and types of breads, buns and pastries to choose from. They also provide cooked foods such as big breakfast. The buns were quite good, soft, balanced between the sweetness and buttery. Coffee a bit bitter but overall it was hot and nice.

Services were reasonable. Prices were above average. - 2 months ago | (4⭐) Garlic Bread with Cream Cheese was very garlicky, with quite a strong raw garlic taste (iykyk). Mushroom soup in bread bowl was abit expensive, and very salty for my taste. Overall, good to try once but would not return again.

But the shop quite congested, so have to be careful if you’re bringing big shopping bags 😂 don’t knock things over.

Already paid using debit card.. and the transaction is successful..
but suddenly the indian guy.. come run to me.. he said the transaction was failed (he said because the payment receipt not come out from the machine) , but at the same time, my account deduct the money already .. so need me to repay back .. because of the staff lack of knowledge, forcing like crazy, keep saying stupid things, very bad on problem solvings (which is, they have to call their bank centre first, because of so lazy to do so, they choose to force customers to pay double with guarantee bank will refund the money). so i have to pay another RM20.95 but until now no refundable from bank..
so total i spend is RM 41.90 for only treats that cost me RM20.95 . Such a scam! ..
Not worth it..i won’t go here again! - 7 months ago | (5⭐) I’ve gotten hamsters from them and they’re all so cute!!!

They were having a 20% discount offer for their hot food offerings when I visited.

I ordered the chicken pie that came with a side of brown gravy and mashed potato. The pie crust was okay although I wished it was a little lighter and fluffier. It was also not as warm as I would have preferred it. Nonetheless, the filling was flavorful with a mix of chicken and mushroom. For the price however, they could have given more pieces of chicken.

Service was relatively fast although there were only 2 occupied tables. Seating was comfortable and the decor had a nicer minimalist look that I appreciate. - 2 months ago | (4⭐) I popped into Pineyard at Sunway Pyramid with my mum recently, hoping to find a cosy spot for brunch. We decided on the grilled sourdough sandwich first; it was nicely buttered and crisp on the outside but turned out rather hard and chewy. The filling of mushrooms, spinach, and cheese had a lovely flavour, albeit a bit on the oily side.

The carbonara was rich, creamy, and made even more indulgent by a runny poached egg. The deep-fried chicken ham added a satisfying crunch and extra savouriness. We also had an iced gula melaka and an orange juice—both decent choices.

Price-wise, Pineyard leans slightly towards the higher end, but I must say the service was prompt and friendly. - 2 weeks ago | (5⭐) I had their carbonara for dinner and it was so good, I really love it. I also bought their pasties and they're really soft even if you eat it the next day.

The price for the dish and pastries are slightly expensive but I'd say it matched with the quality of the food.

The guard at the door was also pleasant and friendly.

The only ones behaving badly were many of the customers. Violently shaking boxes, pinching and squishing even, and sometimes just being a general nuisance by blocking shelves without buying anything. Seriously - there's nothing wrong with the shop or staff. It's the customers. - a month ago | (3⭐) Expected better shopping experience. Perhaps next round I should try the outlet at 1 Utama instead. Was planning to 1 star only, but a sweet lady which I supposed that she’s the manager or supervisor, she explained to me in a very polite manner and give me extra paper bags since she knew that I’m gifting to my friends. - 5 months ago | (4⭐) Labubu plushie OOS gais.

The place is neat and organized, so it’s easy to find what you need. The stationery section really stands out if you’re into that kind of thing. Service was just okay—nothing special, but they get the job done. It’s a huge store, and it has everything you’d expect for a quick browse. Overall, a reliable spot if you’re in the mall and need books or supplies, and definitely worth checking out! - 5 months ago | (5⭐) Hi I was a tourist that visited this bookshop on Thursday and I had asked for a Malaysian cook book to cook nasi lemak and satay skewers and chicken rendang the two young Malaysian hijab girls were very helpful and stopped what they were doing and walked with me to the section and flicked through the pages to find the perfect one I can’t thank them enough give them the recognition they deserve (also they didn’t have name tags but I will attach photos of the books) terima kasih - a month ago | (5⭐) They always have a special price. They have Dragon Ball comics, etc. but perhaps Popular can put a chairs like other bookstores. I’m a disabled person & it is hard for me to take a rest while shopping in the store. There’s no place for me to sit for a while. - a year ago | (1⭐) Popular Sunway pyramid store manager, please manage your cashier counter as customer queue is not moving at all for 10 mins, do not exploit or mistreat your customers’ trust and support. - 3 months ago | (4⭐) This is probably one of the biggest Popular outlets around and it has a variety of books to choose from, especially their English fiction section. I love that they're always adding and updating more new books, and that they regularly have promotions going on.

However, sometimes they have too many overlapping promotions that even their system cannot handle and the staff are not familiar with. There have been too many instances where I find same books (same publication, size etc), but they're tagged different prices. Some books are tagged a certain amount but when I got to the counter, they said they were tagged wrongly and the price was actually higher than displayed by the tag.

As a regular patron, this had happened too many times especially when they have many different promotions at the same time (ie all books for 20% for 2 books or more but they also have 10% on fiction so if you buy fiction, even if you buy 2 books or more, you're only entitled to get 10% each). This makes the shopping experience here very unpleasant. The only way to know for sure how much you have to pay exactly is by checking at the counter, which is troublesome especially if there's large crowd.

However, other than this, I really like this outlet because of the variety of books available. Hope they'll improve on the system and pricing especially when they want to have overlapping discounts. - 2 years ago",POPULAR bookstore @ Sunway Pyramid,+60 3-5637 7280,"Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Tuesday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Wednesday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Thursday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Friday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Saturday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Sunday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM"

I was mailing a photocard to my friend and needed an envelope so I went here to inquire. The 2 ladies kept saying they don’t sell envelope and cannot help me mail it, so I was searching other places in pyramid that I can buy an envelope from while taking a seat there for rest. While sitting, I received a call from my father and took the call quietly in Korean (as I’m Korean) and quickly finished the call. After the call finished, the 2 ladies had a 180 attitude change towards me, beckoned me to the counter as they now suddenly “wanted to help” and can help me mail my cards. All the while asking me about my heritage and saying “oh sorry I thought you were Indonesian or Chinese.” I was flabbergasted at their attitude and how it suddenly changed after they knew I was Korean, so I left the store and went somewhere else to mail my things. - 6 months ago | (5⭐) No queue on monday at 11:50am, nice and friendly staff, she even let me borrow her glue.

As this is my first time trying the fries and chicken pop corn, I ask him is there any recommendation or any signature flavor for the fries… he rudely told me that there no recommendation… whatever u like, you choose…

It is so rude that I don’t feel like buying it after order the set that cost 18.80, can’t clearly remember what the price…  it’s nothing wrong with the taste as I haven’t try it, but it’s the staff attitude that piss off customers.. hope that the management will look into this staff otherwise he is ruining your company hard build reputation & name. - 4 months ago | (1⭐) Good food but super slow service when they had the marketing team to shoot the video and most importantly the marketing team bring the phone close toward the food, when we not sure whether they sanitise it?

However, recent visit to this particular Putien restaurant located at Sunway Pyramid was disappointing. Perhaps it was due to Chinese New Year that the dishes from the set meal were served in a rush and a few of the dishes were served at the same time.

The table is not big enough and the staff were busy transferring the dishes to smaller plates. It was chaotic and customers were not able to eat in peace. The acoustic was poor and it was really noisy. The squirrel fish was over fried and stingy with the sauce. Would not recommend to dine in this particular branch. - 2 weeks ago | (3⭐) Visited today for dinner.

There is a meal set that suits 3-4 people with only RM188. We normally will order the meals set that comes with their popular dishes, eg. Deep Fried Squirrel Fish, lychee meat, special spinach, crispy oyster etc. And added a few more side dishes.
The service is good and friendly staff. Their price is on the high side, and it is good for business dining or for some special occasions. - 4 months ago | (5⭐) Two of us had dinner at Putien this evening. We decided to have Braised Bean Curd with Chinese Cabbage and Fried Heng Hwa Bee Hoon. The Braised Bean Curd had a simple broth but the ingredients made it very flavourful. Putien is generous in their ingredients content. The Bee Hoon vermicelli is very fine and though the condiments look very basic, it was the best Bee Hoon we had tasted so far. The service by Alvin Lim was really great as he introduced himself to us and said to call on him should we need further assistance. He was very polite and attentive.

On the 21/11/2024, I bought my AirPods 4 in Nu Sentral @ Machines.
However, on the 29/11/2024, I found out that my left side AirPods had this windy sound which should not be there. I went to the nearest Machines and they told me that I have to go for their service provider, which the nearest is Sunway Pyramid for me.

First Visit (29/11): After getting my AirPods diagnosed, the staff and the technician said it was fine. I was very doubtful, and I left. BUT! The issue came back again! So, I booked another appointment with the service provider.

Second Visit (30/11): I left my AirPods with them again and I agreed to the 3-7 days checking.

Third Visit (3/12): I was told that my AirPods were fine. SHOCKED with the outcome, I tested the AirPods in front of them and the issue is STILL THERE. I even told the staff to try it out, and the staff let the technician tried it out too.
Guess what? THEY JUST CONFIRMED THE ISSUE RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

I was like: Wait, I waited FOR NOTHING.

The pissed off moment was: Even though I bought my AirPods on the 21/11, I have not done ANY damages to it (why would I? RM829 weyh), I solely DESERVE a full-on exchange of the product.

But? The service provider staff SAID NO. You have to leave the AirPods 4 AGAIN to check if the issue persists.

I was like: WAIT. HOLD UP. You just confessed that there IS an issue. Why do you need to wait for it again?
I demanded a full-on exchange of the ENTIRE product. The staff had to go back and called the manager (WHO, BY THE WAY, HE/SHE ISN’T EVEN IN THE OFFICE).
Furiously, I demanded to talk to the manager on the phone, but the staff refused to.
After the bickering, the staff went back in the room, came out, and agreed to swap THE LEFT SIDE OF THE AIRPODS 4.
I was like, NO WAY. I am entitled to have a full exchange of the product.

Conclusion:-
1. I am still waiting for another 3-7 days.
2. I want a full-on exchange (didn’t get it)
3. And the manager isn’t there at all.

Unprofessional and betrayed by the service of Machines and this service provider.

I will keep on updating my complaint.

In 1984, two entrepreneurial brothers from South America named Fernando and Santiago Aguerre founded REEF out of a love for the beach and surfing.Their idea was to create high-quality, super comfortable products that fit the lifestyle they loved.
Fernando and Santi walked everywhere, so they created sandals that could take them to the beach, into town and wherever they wanted to go – in comfort.
The brothers redefined, redesigned and reengineered every component of the sandal. That attention to detail and an uncompromising standard of quality made Reef the most comfortable sandals anybody had ever worn.

When I at the counter, a Malay male staff was very occupied with his mobile phone, obviously personal events as I can hear his voice messages. He ignored and walk in customer. I was later attended by another short hair lady that was doing her paperwork. She appears to be lack of product knowledge, questions posted such as which one is less milky taste, what’s inside an orange/cherry choc (half pure orange half pure cherry? Or mixture of these flavour?), her reply is “I don’t know, I don’t know”. Seriously? However, she is polite. Until payment, the male staff still on his phone. So I left the choc at store and returned to pick up my choc after two hours, I was attended by the male staff, he is STILL busy with his voice messages. While attending to me, his hand still swiping his phone. This is unacceptable.

Bankara’s brand values and product offerings are unmistakably Japanese, yet differentiated from the market competitors in tantalizing the customers dining experience, namely the palette and sensory immersion.
Embracing the philosophy “Cooking by Heart”’ the Bankara brand is the result of Mr. Kusano’s desire to constantly innovate and improve the taste of Japanese ramen. Drawing upon his family’s expertise handed down through the generations, Mr. Kusano embarked on a request in selecting the finest of ingredients and cooking techniques, to develop a new ramen soup recipe.
In 1998, the “Impact” taste so broadly associated with the brand, heralded the arrival of the Bankara Signature Ramen. The journey to tantalise our customer’s five senses; taste, smell, sight, sound and touch, begin here.
(Taste & Smell) “Cooking by Heart”, Bankara Ramen Malaysia serves four authentic Japanese ramen styles namely Bankara Signature, Tonkotsu ramen, Miso ramen and Tsukemen. Each ramen style is clearly defined by the soup and accompanying noodles of varying thickness and texture. We are proud to serve the same quality and flavour in every bowl of ramen, as one would come to expect if one was dining in Japan. Selected ingredients imported from Japan, attention to details and preparation ensures we serve the most authentic “Impact” taste ramen that you will truly savour and crave for.
(Sight, Sound & Touch) True to the brand values, Bankara Malaysia’s stores draws its design inspiration from various traditional Japanese architectures, art and design elements.",LG2.131A (Lower Ground 2 Floor),"(4⭐) Tried their recommended Kakuni Bankara, the broth base is shoyu, so expect a quite high level of saltiness. The pork belly has been cooking for so long, it just melts as soon as your chopsticks touch it. Not my kind of noodles, it's on the thicker side, but it grabs onto the broth very well. Just wished they given us the option to choose the level doneness of the noodles. The tsukemen is probably three times the salty level of the ramen, but it's good none the less. The option to add garlic tableside was great. Really elevates the flavour of the broth. - 2 weeks ago | (4⭐) Tried their tonkatsu broth and is flavorsome and thick. Although too salty for me, but will probably suit those who prefers strong flavors. The kakuni and chasiu is tender and juicy,  5 ⭐.

Service is excellent with friendly smiles. - 3 months ago | (5⭐) Ramen Bankara at Sunway Pyramid offers a fantastic dining experience for ramen lovers. The tonkotsu broth is rich, flavorful, and comforting, and the noodles are perfectly cooked. The menu offers a variety of options, from classic ramen to delicious side dishes. The ambiance is cozy, and the service is friendly and efficient. It’s a great spot for a hearty meal, especially after a day of shopping. Highly recommended for anyone craving a satisfying bowl of ramen! - 2 months ago | (4⭐) They have a wide range of ramen on their menu. Since it was our first time eating there, the staff shared how to get the most enjoyment from eating what we ordered.

Kakuni Ban broth is light but flavourful, adding garlic to it enhances the taste. They also provide a garlic press at the table to crush the garlic cloves. Tonkotsu Chashu has a rich broth and adding sesame seeds enriches the broth. Miso broth is already rich, great for seasoned eaters. Make sure the steamed rice and chopped chashu, marinated in sweet soy sauce, are mixed well for Negi Buta Meshi. The taste gets better by adding cut ginger into it.

Food arrived fairly quick and staff were attentive in refilling our green tea when we needed it. - a week ago | (4⭐) Ramen Bankara at Sunway Pyramid is another nice place for ramen lovers.

Tried the spicy & black garlic ones..., Both were equally delicious. Worth repeating if the soupy craving hit me again.

Also tried the fried dumplings. It was edible.. not too bad but I wished they fried it properly. So it's nice and crispy

Service was nothing to write about. It's neither good nor bad. Unmemorable actually.

Food was served in reasonable time, considering I was in my  hangry mode. - 4 months ago | (4⭐) I recently visited Ramen Matsuri and ordered the Black Garlic Special Ramen. The dish was superb—packed with rich, bold flavors, and the ramen itself had that perfect stringy texture I love. The broth was delicious and well-balanced, making every bite enjoyable.

However, I’m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I noticed the staff brought out the rubbish bin through the front door in front of customers, which wasn’t ideal. Apart from that, everything else was fantastic! Definitely worth a visit for the ramen alone.

Feel free to tweak it as you like! - 4 months ago | (5⭐) I have always love simple ramen and in my opinion, Matsuri Ramen have the best Toripaitan Ramen. The food are served hot and fast, services are good too! - 5 months ago | (5⭐) One of my favourite places to get simple ramen. I usually get the Torikoku Original, which is a ramen dish with lightweight but flavourful chicken broth. They're always super generous on the chicken - they're so thick and big, and I'd struggle to finish everything unless I'm absolutely starving.

I also love the black fungus topping - it adds a nice crunch, and they give plenty of chopped green things (don't know what it is but it adds nice flavour).

I love the noodles they use too. They're nice and thin, and never undercooked or overcooked. They always taste on point. The chicken broth tastes best hot (always served hot anyway) and is great for rainy days.

I'm surprised it's almost always empty when I come here haha. I think the price charged for the quality of food is very reasonable. I hope more people will come here more often because I don't want one of my favourite ramen places to close down...I haven't found any other place that serves ramen like this 🙏🙏🙏

The ventilation can improve a bit more though. Last last ime I went it was so very stuffy. It's been improving though. - a year ago | (2⭐) The Ramen Matsuri restaurant offers an underwhelming experience with its Red Spicy ramen lacking in umami richness and depth of flavor.

1.    This was my first time dining at the restaurant.
2.	I was particularly impressed by the front counter staff member, Nicole, who provided an excellent introduction to the menu. Her friendly demeanor and warm smile made the experience welcoming, and she explained the menu thoroughly, understanding customers’ preferences and offering tailored recommendations. Her attentiveness and professionalism in promoting the dishes contributed to a positive first impression.
3.	Regarding the dining experience, there was one point of dissatisfaction with the garlic butter side dish. Although I ordered garlic butter, it arrived without any butter. I requested it a second time, but unfortunately, it was still served without butter. I also noticed a customer at a nearby table sharing similar feedback with the staff.
4.	When I mentioned this issue to Nicole, she was genuinely surprised and expressed her intention to relay the feedback to her supervisor. Her responsiveness and willingness to address the concern, despite it being a minor issue, were greatly appreciated.

Overall Impression: Aside from the missing butter, the overall dining experience was enjoyable, thanks largely to Nicole’s kindness and helpfulness.

All the staff have to go through deep and serious training. Even the foods was so so only, everywhere is very messy tot think that it's not that busy. And even though on busy times should not let your buffet bar messy, dirty tissues everywhere, veggies all over the place. Staffs no basic manners, clear table just take plates, serve the food just bang on your table without saying anything. All are black face and not talking, robot is better at least they greet but these people nothing. But when they are chatting while clearing tables their voices are so loud and happy back to customer gave you poker unhappy face. Most of the waitresses hair are so messy too not appropriate in F&B standard. Kitchen door widely open can see how messy and dirty inside, staff room door open too showing us all shoes while eating is it? The another long hair waitress arranging all the pots banging so loud makes the diners disturb if not happy why not go back home. Ice cream melted, waffle bitter and put there no cover at all. Your golden soup is the worse I've ever tasted too no taste at all, other beef cutting is wrong side making it so tough. Most of the sauces are all chili taste without any saltiness or sweetness I know we can add on seasoning but do we need to adjust everything on our own meh? I came here because it was recommended by my colleague who always eat at Sunway Velocity, she said must try very nice. I was totally in regret that I tried and paid full price with 10% service charge without even providing any service. - a month ago | (5⭐) food are 9/10! especially their ice cream is sooooo CREAMY and not too sweet.

The buffet is about 40 rinngit gross, but that includes the mains to drinks and desserts.  Dining limits to 90 mins.

Quite a few choices of base soup. it's less tasty than arashi, though, but very accoetable for its price. . Many staff were  around to help.

Taste-wise its really not bad and they don't skimp on ingredients.

Ordered chicken kebab today (though I almost got hurt biting into a bone chip). Saw another review here that they also found bone chips in their kebabs. Something that I've not encountered in their other outlets. Perhaps a quality control issue.

The newly renovated stuff'd now uses machine ordering. The machine lagged when I was making payment, and staff were too busy to entertain my problems because Grab riders were more of a priority. After awhile, one of them rerouted the payment to the normal counter cashier (what was the point of the machine, then?)

Waiting time: Almost 20 minutes for a kebab. Not really acceptable considering most customers are here during their short lunch break. Like I've mentioned up there, they prioritize Grabfood more than walk-in orders.

The space is too tiny for the amount of customers that drop by. Best to takeaway.
Probably won't be back in a long time until they've fixed their machines and service. - 4 months ago | (3⭐) Update**
Bought kebab today and it's absolutely soaked. Dripping everywhere as soon as I start eating and towards the end it was hard to even take a bite with all the water. Maybe teach your staff to properly drain the vege so we don't end up with damp kebab.

Frequent this place, always order chicken, today first time order beef and regretted. There were 3 bone chips in my beef kebab, could easily had chip my tooth. - 9 months ago | (3⭐) so is it burrito or kebab?

if the former, then it simply isn't as good as the competition round the corner.  which is the general dilemma of ""premium"" fast food. - 3 weeks ago | (5⭐) As was ordering for a lunch meeting, pre-ordered the bowls.

The bowls were made just prior to collection as they were packing up when I reached.

The veg bowl option selected is  guacamole (hummus is the other, or can add it with a charge).

The sauces selected were habanero sauce (fiery & it lit my day) & mayo cucumber. The cilantro rice has a good flavour.

In a very short space of time Swatch has become one of the most famous brands in the world – and all the while remaining true to itself.

Unfortunately, the new strap was scratched during installation. When I pointed it out, the staff explained that it was due to the difficulty of installing the strap and said they couldn't do anything about it.

I even tried polishing the screen afterward, but the scratches remain visible. (Image in reference). While I understand challenges can arise, I expected more care and a better resolution. I hope the team can improve their service for similar situations in the future. - a month ago | (4⭐) Energy For Life's free battery replacement comes with a key condition that many are not aware nor it is stated in their Swatch Malaysia website. The condition is that the watch must be presented for the free battery replacement with the old battery regardless whether it leaking chemical or in any condition. Even if you have to remove the chemical leaking old battery, you must keep it for them.

I strongly suggest Swatch Malaysia amend their website to state this condition clearly and also train their staff to advise customers accordingly.

It shock me to see the food come out this way. Big brand, but presentation and food quality is totally out. Ordered the Sundubu Jjigae RM26 (soup is cook with chilli flakes. Too much, it tends to be bitter), taste like f*&^%.....oooops mind my language, tofu smashed, eggs gone, my jjigae become a pile of vomits (check out my photo & Sakae photo). Kimchi fried rice RM22 (portion was unbelievable small) & finally Kyushu Paitan Ramen Rm20 (Soup terribly oily, noddles overcook, taste wise 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢) . Well, bye-bye & tata to this restaurant. Horrible meal. I seldom give 1 star unless it's really terrible. - 2 months ago | (2⭐) Had the worst shoyu ramen today. Soggy noodles, tasteless broth. It's a large portion of noodles, which is usually a good thing for me but with this one it felt like it took forever to finish it because it just wasn't good. Added probably 2 tbsp of their table soy sauce into the soup. It's possible the dish was left too long before it was served, because there was very little soup - maybe all soaked up by the noodles 🙈  Even my husband, who likes his noodles soft, didn't enjoy this.

The kimchi lava fried rice was also mediocre - the rice was mushy (my husband liked it that way tho), not enough flavour so this also had to be eaten with their soy sauce. The ""lava"" is just a runny egg omelette - you need to top up cheese to get the cheesey effect shown in the photos. At least we got a 20% discount for this dish though.

Service was decent, place is clean and tidy. But never coming back here. Super regret that we decided to try this (enticed by the photos!) instead of going to our regular noodle place 2 doors down. - 2 months ago | (4⭐) Less crowd this section of place.

Albeit the food was okay, the environment wasn't very clean. It looks clean from the outside but small cockroaches are walking around on the table. It really put off the mood to eat.

The lack of communication, persistent stock shortages, and difficulty in reaching the service centre have caused significant inconvenience. Below is a timeline of the incident and my key concerns.

Timeline of the Incident:
16 February 2025 – I contacted the Sunway Pyramid service centre to schedule a screen replacement for my Samsung S23 Ultra. I was informed that the screen was out of stock but would be restocked on 18 February 2025. Following this, I requested to book an appointment for 22 February 2025, and the service centre advised me to send my details via WhatsApp. I did so, and they acknowledged my request with a ""noted"" response. Based on this, I assumed my appointment was confirmed.

22 February 2025 – I called the service centre to reschedule my appointment to 23 February 2025. It was only then that I was informed that the screen was still out of stock.

Complaint Points:
Poor Communication – If I had not called on 22 February, I would have traveled to the service centre on 23 February only to find out the screen was still unavailable. Why wasn’t I informed in advance that the stock had not arrived? As a service provider, the service centre should proactively notify customers if their scheduled repairs cannot proceed due to stock unavailability.

Frequent Stock Shortages – Why does the service centre frequently face stock shortages for essential replacement parts? Does this mean customers will always have to wait indefinitely to get their devices repaired? Being unable to use my phone for an extended period has caused unnecessary inconvenience, and potential financial losses.

Extremely Difficult to Contact – I found it extremely difficult to reach the service centre. As an authorized service provider for a global brand like Samsung, the service centre should have a more accessible and responsive customer support system.

The poor service I experienced has been frustrating and unacceptable. As a loyal Samsung customer, I expect better service quality and a more reliable repair process - in the last week | (2⭐) Left my fold 4 with the center on Saturday, received a call to collect in on Thursday. They claim to replace the screen but I can see that it is still the same screen (there is a slight mark on the screen. It is still there, meaning it's the same screen). They fix the issue with the phone turning off when using the inner screen. However, the center returned my phone with scratches and screen bubbling. They do not handle your phone with care. I suggest take lots of photo and video as evidence before you hand over to them. - 6 months ago | (5⭐) came in with a flip 3 samsung that half of the screen was damage, i want to tranfers my data from that phone but couldnt since the screen cant be use. the obvious solution was to replace the flip 3 screen that cost rm1k but i dont want to do that since it was an old phone and already have a new one. however, there was this nice uncle samsung worker who go out of his way to help me, even took out a usb mouse to help me tranfer the data. couldnt be more grateful for the uncle - 2 weeks ago | (1⭐) Brought my s20 to repair for cracked screen but after repair my screen have issues with tapping which it move around itself. Visiting 2nd time within a week and informed that my phone when sent it to them it is already have this issue which supposed I am sure supposed not to be. As luckily I have video record as proof my phone condition before left my phone to them.

The problem didn't been solved and I don't wish to send my phone there again. Now it become my backup phone and I bought another new phone because of their poor workmanship.

Please be reminded they may told you estimated 4 to 5 working days but you still need to chase them for a follow-up and at last can be taken even more than 1 week time to collect your item. Worst thing is your phone's problem didn't get solved after long waiting time.

I am a Samsung users for more than 10 years but tbh if your phone have problems, it is better you find phone repair specialist rather than their authorized service center. Why? because my new phone's screen cracked again and i decided to bring my to phone repair specialist. Price is similar to them but service lagi tip-top. - 3 weeks ago | (5⭐) Am really happy with the attentiveness and the problem solving measures done by the customer service personal.

Shop smart! - 2 months ago | (1⭐) I recently visited Sephora to inquire about a tinted moisturizer, and while the consultant initially seemed helpful, things took a sharp turn when I decided not to make a purchase. Her attitude shifted noticeably, and she walked off without so much as a polite closing remark. I understand that not every consultation leads to a sale, but being professional and courteous shouldn’t depend on the customer’s buying decision.

It was disappointing to feel dismissed for simply taking time to consider my options. Sephora is known for creating a welcoming shopping environment, but this experience fell short. I hope this feedback can serve as a reminder to maintain consistency in customer service, regardless of the outcome. - 3 months ago | (5⭐) Had a wonderful experience with Alice from Sephora Sunway Pyramid today.

Burger had sufficient crust and the meatiness came thru. I appreciate a burger that’s more about the meat and cheese and less about the sauce it’s drowned in. Was better than the one in TRX.

Fries were fresh, crispy and well salted but I’m not a fan of crinkle cut. The 50-50 had a strong lemony taste with a hint of tea. Not too sweet.

Overall not too bad, though go into it like you’re getting a burger at a sit down restaurant, not fast food as the prices are definitely not cheap. - a month ago | (2⭐) Honestly expected a lot from a burger for this price range I mean its not five guys lol.

Taste was average or should I say no taste at all ? Loads of meat does NOT equal to good food.

Exorbitant price for the burger and it comes on its own ? Bro are you serious no sides I mean at least should mention that on the menu so that we can order the sides together.

Well tried both the normal fries and cheese fries both were below average.

Nothing in particular that stands out except the hype.

In short doesn’t taste like what it looks like. - a week ago | (5⭐) Located at the entrance of Sunway Pyramid. This is the second Shake Shack American burger restaurant in town (1st outlet at TRX).

The burgers here looks small in size but really packs a punch! Their signature smoky flavours makes it quite hard to stop eating as soon as you take the first bite. Go for their hot favourite  ""Double Shack"" burger and addictive crinkled cut fries. Hot dog is on the menu too.

Wonderful experience with each and every bite! Definitely worth returning. - a month ago | (3⭐) Not the best, but certainly not the worst burger joint either. Would say that I'd rate Shake Shack a little higher if the prices wasn't so outrageous.
I ordered the Avocado strraky beef burger. Taste-wise, I do l like their burger buns, but the burger itself was lacking any smokeyness or flavor. The ice cream, was just like any other ice cream. And lastly the Malaysia-exclusive Bunga Raya Shake, which was way too sweet too the point that I couldn't finish it.
But other than that, service was great, and the whole place had a nice vibe to it. - 2 months ago | (2⭐) I wouldn’t say the best burger in town. I only love the fact the crispy beef streak was good and the burger is juicy and not greasy. The hotdog was hard and dry. I can’t say I like the shake, too sweet and not thick enough. I didn’t taste the malt. The fries is a big disappointment - just a normal frozen store bought crinkle cut fries and comes with the broken small bits. With that price, should be a fresh thick cut real potatoes. - a month ago",Shake Shack Sunway Pyramid,N/A,"Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Tuesday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Wednesday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Thursday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Friday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Saturday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Sunday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM"

Our masseurs were very skillful.

At first they suggested for us to take packages, but we weren’t sure whether we would like the massage as many masseurs were not that good based on past experiences.

But they proved us wrong. Next trip we will take the package and visit at least once or twice a month.

We were served by two different receptionist and both were polite with us. After seeing the reviews here, we thought we would experience the same rudeness. Glad that they have improved their customer service.

Overall I'm happy with the service provided by the staff , from the front desk staff to the masseuse. They served cold tea before the massage, which was perfect on a hot sunny day. The massage took place in a cinema-like room and they would play a movie during the whole process. After the massage, the masseuse served us hot ginger tea. The only thing that spoiled my whole experience was a group of customers who were being so loud and talking on the phone. Good thing they arrived when my massage was about to end. I hope Healthland can impose a rule for customers to be quiet and phones should be on vibrate/silent mode. - 5 years ago | (5⭐) Finally enjoyed a nice 2 hours Aroma Oil treatment massage and it was legendarily great.

Twice we correct him. 3rd time he brought the shirt that my fiancé tried and removed the price tag and at the same time he brought the new shirt. Then he said the price is rm149. I did where is the price tag in earlier shirt and why did you removed it. The stupid answer he gave me ""the display shirt is from other outlet and the new shirt from our outlet"". Different outlet different price. Really you guys have different outlet different price range for same shirt? - a year ago",SmartMaster - Sunway Pyramid,N/A,N/A

In 2008, Smiggle jumped overseas and opened its first international store in New Zealand. By 2011 Smiggle has expanded into Singapore, and in 2014 Smiggle opened its doors in the United Kingdom. In 2016 Smiggle said hello to Malaysia, Hong Kong & Ireland! It's all part of the grand plan to be the world's most exciting and famous stationery brand.
Smiggle’s product range is exclusively designed in Melbourne, Australia, and the range is now bigger and better than ever, with the team at the Smiggle Design Lab drawing inspiration from all over the globe!

The shaved ice is incredibly smooth and finely shaved, creating a melt-in-your-mouth experience with every spoonful. What sets it apart is the generous and rich black sesame flavor that infuses each bite. The black sesame balls served alongside are soft and chewy that complements the ice perfectly. Whether indulging in it as a sweet treat after a meal or simply enjoying it as a refreshing snack, it’s often the perfect dessert to cool down and satisfy my cravings whenever I'm at Sunway Pyramid or Pavilion! - 3 weeks ago | (4⭐) There aren't many Snowflake branches around anymore, so it's good to see this one doing well. For after-dinner desserts, Snowflake is a great option. I particularly like the Mango Delight and the Soya series here. There are also hot and ice desserts, whichever you're in the mood for. The branch isn't really big, but it's cosy enough to have a sit down and have a nice chat. Recommended.

Update: They recently went through a renovation, and it looks a lot better. There's also more seating because of it now. So there's more reason to visit. - 2 months ago | (4⭐) Great dessert or any time snack.  Prices are a little high but the stuff is tasty.  Staff are friendly and quick with your order.

Highly recommended for dining or buying their products - a week ago | (3⭐) I went to this branch a couple of times but seem like the staffs are not attentive whether they are busy or not.

The soup is not 炖 but a concentrated version. With that I think the price is a bit steep. The bird nest is a tad expensive with the amount of bird nest that mixed with white fungus to confuse non-regular consumers of bird nest. The fried egg truffle is definitely over priced with minimum truffle taste. (Went on 20th Dec 2024).

I visited another time on 3rd Jan 2025 and went back to have the herbal chicken which has lower chance to go wrong.

Seeing that there was no one in line behind me, I said I wanted to change B currency, he said no, he could only change money from one country per person at a time, which means I had to wait until someone came to queue up to change money before I could change money for the third time?

Meanwhile counter 2 is open, then I pointed to counter 2 and asked if I could change money, counter 1 said NO, because counter 2 is new and he didn’t know how to do it.

Meanwhile counter 2 is open, then I pointed to counter 2 and asked if I could change money, counter 1 said NO, because counter 2 is new and he didn’t know how to do it.

Definitely a five-star café worth visiting! - 2 months ago | (1⭐) Based on my previous visiting experience, I confirmed that the latest batch of the barista are new. Their service tells me everything.

First, they doesn't seems very familiar with the name of the drink on the reserved menu. They need to double check on the menu to confirm what's really customer mentioned when place order.

Secondly, the ticket doesn't place / stick well to the drinks producing counter. It caused that no barista noticed that there are a pending order to make (reserve coffee menu). After all, they keep calling customer name while food ready but nobody making the drink.

At the end,  the drink has served finally, but as photo shown, been ordered a Reserve menu coffee, but served without the Starbucks Reserve black sleeve and the complimentary chocolate. Definitely not well trained enough.

P.S. t
Then I saw a barista served the food over to a female customer to her table but forgot the drink itself. The female customer has to get up and go over the waiting section to get the drink by herself after all.

Not friendly, not polite, almost fall down bring my food just in front of my table without any single apologise directly throw the food on my table. I was quite shocked honestly but she's just not supposed to be in F&B industry. If u had a bad day, it's the worse decision to throw it to customers.

Divided into several sections, highlights of the Sunway Lagoon include:
• Sunway Lagoon Extreme Park
It is the best place to get your adrenaline pumping! Feel the rush with aerial attractions like bungee jumping, flying fox, riding a Go Kart or an ATV, wall climbing and so much more!
• Sunway Lagoon Water Park
The Sunway Lagoon Water Park is a great stop to beat the Malaysian heat. From daring water spins in the African Pythons loop ride, to the Congo Challenge, Vuvuzela and Waterplexx 5D, be ready for a grand, wet day out in the sun! For those looking for a more relaxing pace, drop by the Surf Beach, which is said to be the world's largest man-made surf beach (arrive early to grab a curtained gazebo for that extra tropical feeling).
Of course proper swimming attire is required for this section of the park, changing rooms and lockers are provided.
• Sunway Lagoon Amusement Park
Do not want to get wet? You can explore the amusement park and walk on the bridge in Sunway lagoon theme park which is known as Malaysia’s longest pedestrian.
• Nickelodeon Lost Lagoon
This is Asia's first Nickelodeon themed park and includes exciting water rides and attractions. Enjoy your day in the company of memorable Nickelodeon characters from Spongebob Squarepants, Dora The Explorer and even the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as you explore around with the kids (souvenirs are aplenty too).
• Wildlife Park
Wildlife Park is a great little zoo specializing in cute, cuddly, friendly animals and a few not-so-cuddly ones like eagles, pythons and tigers. The petting enclosure is a major attraction with families, where you can enjoy hand-feeding the rabbits, tortoises, guinea pigs and petting the ponies too!
• Scream Park

With special effects and great actors, let your fears come alive!",LG2.LAGOON (Lower Ground 2 Floor),"(5⭐) Had a really great time with the whole family. The wife was happy to watch some of our stuff near the small wave pool while the kids and I hit the rides. It was a great time for us to go as there were not very big crowds meaning it did not take very long to get on the rides other than climbing all the steps to get up to them. Highly recommended for all the family from young kids to young adults. The big wave pool with 5m high waves every 1 minute from 4.30pm was a highlight too. Make sure you get to the front. - a month ago | (5⭐) Each park was truly fun. There are a lot of activities for you to do despite age. There are many water activities. So, it's wise you wear your swimwear and roam around. There are lockers in every park as I remember and you can rent a locker to keep your belongings safe. I went on  weekend so there were too many people and had to wait in lines for a considerable amount of time. But enter the place when it opens and you can enjoy every activity.

Overall it was a family fun for the whole day. - a month ago | (5⭐) My wife and I recently booked the villa package for 2 days and 1 night at around RM1.6K, and we had an amazing experience! A big thank you to Sunway for allowing us to check in early at 11 AM instead of the usual 2 PM. This thoughtful gesture made our trip so much smoother, as we could head straight to the theme park without worrying about our belongings.

The villa itself was spacious, beautifully designed, and incredibly comfortable—perfect for a relaxing retreat. A special shoutout to Shahmin and his team for their outstanding hospitality; they were friendly, helpful, and truly enhanced our stay. While the food was decent, it could be improved to match the overall high standards of the experience.

Overall, we would rate our stay 8.5/10 and would definitely consider returning. Thank you, Sunway, for a wonderful time! - in the last week | (1⭐) Disappointing Experience – Not Worth the Money

I genuinely cannot understand why this place gets 5-star ratings. The ride attendants are rude and unhelpful, and customer service is clueless—even the so-called “customer specialists” don’t know how to handle guests. The park itself is old, decaying, and poorly maintained. The shacks and huts are a complete waste of time, and the wave pool only operates for 45 minutes at the very end of the day. The whole place smells bad and feels like it’s falling apart.

For a family of five, we spent $700 AUD—absolutely not worth it. There are so many better places in Malaysia to visit for a fraction of the cost. Even with a quick pass, there was no need to wait for rides, which only made the purchase feel like a scam. The photos online are misleading, so don’t fall for the marketing.

They are indeed one of the best ones I have gone to so far. The staffs were very friendly and welcoming. The room was clean and comfy. I love the room's view.

Service was efficient, and the staff accommodated most of our requests immediately.  The room was clean except under the bed because we tried to put the bed together and hence found out about the pile of dirt under it. Equipped with most necessities. Including ironing board.

The pool is only open until 7 pm, which is quite early if you are out the whole day, you wouldn't get to enjoy swimming.

💰 Overall (3/5) - Not Worth the Price

For a 4-star hotel, the price feels too high compared to the overall experience. The location is the only highlight, but service, facilities, and comfort need improvement. - 2 weeks ago | (4⭐) We stayed at Sunway pyramid hotel for one night after 31st night celebration. The location of the hotel is fine. The deluxe room comes with the basic amenities and the space is manageable. Our room was a bit old but it was clean. The body wash in the bathroom had a very foul smell, so probably it has expired. It would be better if the cleaning staff could pay more attention to this. Other than that the room was manageable for a one night stay. - a month ago | (4⭐) Cleanliness could be better. The room offers privacy and a good view. Good value for money. The breakfast spread is good with a wide range of choices. However, it’s a bit of a hassle to walk to Sunway Resort since breakfast is served at the hotel next door. The plus point is it is conveniently located next to Sunway Pyramid Mall. - 3 months ago | (5⭐) Booked 4 rooms. Although initially they mentioned they couldn’t get adjacent rooms for us, but at the end, they managed to do so albeit the check in time for each room varied. They allowed early check in for 3 rooms. Rooms were neat and clean. No free car park though. - a month ago | (4⭐) Sulit hotel!! Good price, biiig rooms and great location. So why not 5 stars??

Being the first world class ice sports entertainment in Malaysia where you can enjoy a day of ice-skating to escape the heat of Kuala Lumpur, Sunway Pyramid Ice has played host to numerous international sports competitions and musicals since 1997. With a rink size spanning 39m x 22.5m, shoppers can have a breathtaking view of this ice-skating rink's sleek-modern design from above thanks to glass panels surrounding each level. On and off, you can catch a sight of experienced skaters practising their routines and perfecting their stunts, as Sunway Pyramid Ice is part of ISIAsia (Ice Skating Institute Asia), which trains professional figure-skaters in Malaysia.
Spend only a total of RM20 on weekdays, RM25 on weekends and RM28 during school and public holidays to enjoy the ice-skating rink as much as you like. Although it is a prerequisite to wear gloves and socks when ice-skating, these items are readily available at the ticketing counter for RM6 and RM9 respectively.
It is the birth place where many local skating talents are born and trained by Sunway Pyramid Ice very own coaches through its Skating Academy. Beginners without skating knowledge may opt to take up 30 minute lessons with rates starting at RM70 on weekdays and RM75 on weekends. As you get better in your ice-skating skills, advance lessons may then be an option. This could be a good opportunity for children and young teens to pick up a new skill during school holidays with packages and interesting discounts for classes. Due to its close proximity to Petaling Jaya’s many five-star hotels, universities and colleges, as well as the Sunway Lagoon Theme Park, Sunway Pyramid Ice can get very crowded during the weekends, so it is highly recommended for customers to arrive early to avoid the long queue.",B1 (Basement 1),"(1⭐) You ride in a huge puddle, if you don't skate very well, take a change of clothes with you.

According to their rules, you must ride in gloves, gloves can be bought at the entrance for 9rm (their cost price is not more than 2rm) - I think everyone understands why it is necessary to ride in gloves.

I rented PREMIUM skates - they gave out ancient, worn boots with torn clips and laces 😅

And most importantly, the skates are absolutely not stoned, it's impossible to skate.

The lockers are free, it's good, but I literally had to bend the lock and lock the door to close my drawer.

The toilet is free (thank you), but it doesn't smell very good.

In general, a dubious pleasure for Overprice - 2 weeks ago | (1⭐) ""WE WERE GLIDING ON WATER, NOT SKATING ON ICE"" ❌❌❌❌

HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE THIS TUME⛔⛔⛔

We booked Season 3, it was already wet and watery
Within a few minutes, it became sooo watery and slippery you cannot skate anymore

So many people were skating and falling which made it impossible to enjoy it this time. - 3 months ago | (5⭐) Recommended place for ice skating. RM35/per head on school holidays, buy online RM30 only. - 5 months ago | (3⭐) Overall we had a good time however, there are room for improvements. The floor is wet and just worsen over time. So if you fall, expect to get soaked in cold waters. The surface isn't as smooth as other place I've visited.

They provide free locker rental. - 4 weeks ago | (5⭐) Malaysia's 1st proper ice skating rink that is world-class standard and always has people skating. On weekends, the rink can be crowded.

I really like the vibe during weekdays, not too many people and too busy. I ordered some salmon or tuna set(i forgot) as you can see in one of the pictures.  It was good and the price really affordable for 1 set. The most delicious dish in the shop was chawanmushi. I like it soo much, it was not too smelly like a fishy smell(coz of the egg). It really cleans your taste buds after eating the fresh tuna/salmon(dip too much sauce,salty). One thing, I didn't like about the place was that you needed to order through the QR code provided on the table, i have a problem connecting it for 15Minutes and gotta call the staff to help me. Overall, a great and delicious delicacy to dine in here. - 5 months ago | (5⭐) Good service and explanation from the staff name Joanne.

The only complain is their seating. Hard to get up when the sent the ordered menu thru kaiten belt (with the train like item. Haha. Idk the name). Unless i put my leg on the seat, only then can comfortably take the food as it’s place quite high (problem for short people).

Atmosphere is also good. - a month ago | (1⭐) Absolutely disgusted with my experience at Sushi King. The service was beyond atrocious—an unacceptably long wait for everything. The sushi? Low quality, borderline inedible, and definitely not fresh. To top it all off, the ordering tablet was completely useless because it didn’t even have WiFi. How is that even possible in this day and age? And seriously, ONE robot to serve the entire restaurant? What a joke! The whole place felt like a chaotic mess with zero regard for customer satisfaction. I wouldn’t step foot in this place again if they paid me. Avoid at all cost !

The egg, which should have been a soft-cooked egg spread over the rice, felt more like a boiled egg. Additionally, the batter on the fried shrimp was soggy and lacked crispiness. On top of that, there didn’t seem to be enough staff to serve customers efficiently, which affected the overall dining experience.

Worth the quick dessert stop. - 2 months ago | (5⭐) New cafe located at Sunway Pyramid's newly renovated space, The Oasis. Randomly walked past and saw the variety of cakes sitting in the fridge display.

They have alcoholic and non-alcoholic options. We tried 2 non-alcoholic cakes, cempedak cake and chocolate valrhona cake. The cempedak cake was an absolute delight - sponge layer was soft and light, while the cream was sweet and fresh. Couldn't get enough of it!

Unfortunately, the chocolate valrhona was quite disappointing. The supposed mousse inside was hard and didn't taste fresh. Actually, the whole cake felt pretty tough and hard to cut and chew. It just felt like i was eating a few days' old cake.

Besides cake, they sell gelato, waffles and other desserts too. It's definitely worth a try. - a month ago | (5⭐) Their tiramisu gelato is the best tiramisu gelato i’ve had.

2) I remember when this cinema used to be one of the coldest cinemas I went to, and now, it's so stuffy and warm here. Broken AC or just being a cheapskate?

Please CONSIDER these two problems but please deal with problem no. 1 especially. Avoiding this cinema until they decide to actually fix the smell and the mold problem.

The Owls Cafe started as a cozy neighbourhood cafe in Bukit Jalil, and thanks to the support from our owlsome customers, word spreads fast around Klang Valley. Our much loved Owlsome Waffles - fruity ‘Rebecca’ and nutty ‘David’ are perfectly that fit everyone’s taste. Waffle batter are made from scratch with our very own secret recipe. After toasted to crisp, the waffles are topped off with freshest fruits and hand crafted ice-cream by our local brand, Forty licks, which gives all our waffles their distinctive and unforgettable yumminess.
Beside the Owlsome Waffles, The Owls Cafe also serves great variety of brunch, pasta and specialty coffee. We strive to provide fusion meals that interlard Malaysian flavour with western style.
Experience our owlsomeness now at Sunway Pyramid!",G1.PT.08 (Ground Floor),"(2⭐) For a cafe that heavily advertises their waffles, be prepared to wait at least 40 mins for 1 waffle order. We went at 4pm, off-peak hour. They said they only have 2 waffle maker machines, and each waffle order takes time to prepare. Imagine ordering more than 1! The staff will try their best to avoid you knowing that you will ask for your order. Once the order is delivered, there were no apologies as they will rush off and away from you as fast as they could. Also, the photos showed whole blueberries and bigger strawberry pieces on the waffles, but you only get them in halves. Who cuts blueberries that are already tiny anyway? 😂 The price charged for the food and service was not worth it. The staffs were not welcoming either, maybe they’re new and don’t know how serve customers. Very disappointing 😢 please do better. - 2 months ago | (3⭐) I recently visited the owl cafe and while the product was fine, I was disappointed with how I was treated by the staff. Unfortunately, I encountered rude and unprofessional behavior, which left a negative impression on what could have been a good experience.

From the moment I walked in, the owl cafe they seemed dismissive and unwilling to help with a rude tone? Did they refuse assistance?. I expect a certain level of courtesy when I visit any establishment, but this encounter made me feel disrespected and unwelcome.

It’s unfortunate because I had heard good things about the owl cafe but the unprofessionalism of the staff really took away from the overall experience. I hope management takes this feedback seriously, as customer service is often the most memorable part of any visit.

I would be hesitant to return unless I see improvements in how customers are treated. - 4 months ago | (4⭐) A cozy cafe in Sunway Pyramid, near the Sunway Lagoon Hotel side. I like the owl themed deco, with the light streaming through the glass wall overlooking Sunway Lagoon theme park. I shifted my table there but realized it was a little too warm at 6pm, and shifted back to the other corner where there were cushion seats.

The salad made me feel so healthy - it was colourful and delicious. I wanted to try the savoury chicken waffle, but ended up eating the chicken with the salad, and treating the fluffy waffle as my dessert! 🤣 - 6 months ago | (5⭐) The Owls Cafe in Sunway Pyramid offers a delightful selection of desserts that are sure to satisfy any sweet tooth. From waffles to cakes, each dessert is crafted with care and bursts with flavor. The cafe's location provides a stunning view of the Sunway Lagoon Theme Park, making it an ideal spot for visitors to take a break, relax, and enjoy the scenery. With its cozy atmosphere and delicious treats, it’s the perfect place to unwind after a day of shopping or exploring the theme park. - 5 months ago | (4⭐) part of the charm here is expectation of management, which is executed here at maskirova levels.  we managed to order off the waffle and breakfast menus, besides notices that both were unavailable.

the chicken and waffles was very good.  the shasukha less so.  the latter came in a portions too dimunitive, and with a taste profile more italian than moroccan.  so some call to tinker there, and to not reuse the pasta sauce.

So I bought a logitech mouse for 300+ which sells between 250-300 on lazada. You have to understand that all shops here especially the tech shops in Asian Avenue will sell items at higher prices. This is because rent for pyramid is high. Those who give ratings such as *overprice* without a good reason - no comments.

I did NOT buy a laptop so I am not aware of the quality of service this place offers and so you have to take ur own risk when buying from here.

Pros: You can exchange faulty peripherals with other peripherals from other brands within 14 days of purchase if u are a member. (Rm300 purchase gives u free membership).

You also get 1 year warranty.

Cons: Slightly more expensive.

_________

My personal opinion: I try not to buy from lazada and stuff for electronic devices because they is no certification that it is original and it is very difficult to exchange or send ur device for warranty when u purchase it online. I would pay the extra RM 50 for the reassurance from this shop. (Peripherals ONLY)

For laptops: I can't give a review so do keep that in mind. - 6 years ago | (1⭐) Worst store ever. I've let them changed my HDD to SSD.

No one bothered to show us to a table. After waiting for a few minutes, a staff member finally told us to sit wherever we liked. Once we sat down, no one brought us the menu until we asked for it.

The restaurant has a good ambience and a nice view, overlooking part of Sunway Lagoon.

The fried pork was very crispy, but it had an unpleasant smell and wasn’t tender. The side dishes, like cabbage, rice, and soup, were refillable but not for sharing. Since we were still full, we only ordered one set. - 3 months ago | (4⭐) As it is tonkatsu, the menu looks very same for different item, kinda hard to decide what to order.

The pork is hard and take much effort to chew. It's marinated quite well with a unique taste.

Chicken curry is very nice, but chicken portion much smaller and not enough for my liking.

There is a lot of condiments available to mix-in with your meal, the soup and cabbage are freeflow refillable.

Waiters are not very responsible and tend to be a bit slow. - 3 weeks ago | (5⭐) Right from the first staff who allocates you table, to the waitresses who took care of our table - huge thank you for making our family dinner such a pleasant one! Your attention to detail (wait staff saw our uncle gesturing eating rice with spoon to one of us and before we asked, wait staff had come over with a spoon already) and doing your best to get us a big enough table to sit comfortably deserves a huge applause.
Environment was cosy, food was good, and staff were generous in giving us our refills or offering refills when she saw our cabbage/miso/rice were almost done.
Overall a very nice evening, and feeling lucky that we chose to dine here 😄 will definitely be back again, highly recommend! - 2 weeks ago | (2⭐) Came here for the 2nd set of katsu for 50% till 28th Feb only… this place is honestly a miss… you won’t regret it if you have been passing by here often and telling yourself that you’d like to try it one day… I’d say.. keep walking because….. both loin and fillet I ordered wasss DRY…. DRY AF…. D.R.Y!!!! It’s not enjoyable at ALLL….. the fats on the pork did not do justice… knowing the breadcrumbs around it will
Definitely cut the top of your mouth but expecting the pork meat to be tender or atleast melts in your mouth…. ? NOPE… all is dryyyyyyyy it was hard to chew throughout 6pieces…. My jaw was tired…. Flavor wise, not much, very mild, it’s not mind blowing.

The only Thing that was good was the miso soup that came together.
Service of replenishing cabbage was 👍
Choice of white rice or multigrain and comes with tea iced or not.

This will be my first and my last.. - in the last week | (1⭐) Same incident happened again. I’ve saw others put a review regarding their service, we really feel disrespectful and being looked down by their staff just because we ask for refill cabbage and soup.

Before we ordered, we did ask the waiter can we share one main course by adding another side dish? If not we just add in the bottomless refill package. (Here i need to mention that I’ve dine in at another branch - Mid Valley so i knew it was workable. And the reason for us to share is we really can’t finish all if we order two main course)

The waiter said OK without explaining anything. But when we ask for refill he take the menu to us said that if u want to refill you need to add the bottomless refill, but we did ask at the very beginning. He said OK! And the way he explain to us is really make us uncomfortable is like we asking for food. But hello? It’s just cabbage? How much it cost? And fine, i know you have your own rules, but why you didn’t mention it clearly at first?

And after that we said nvm, we continue having the rest of our food. After that he suddenly come over and refilled the cabbage for us, without saying anything. This really makes us feel uncomfortably and disrespectful.

The food tastes good but leans towards a heavier and oilier base. If you can't handle spicy food, I’d recommend avoiding the dishes I ordered.

Portion-wise, the servings are generous, but the pricing is on the higher side. For example, the medium-sized Spicy Sour Soup Dory Fish costs RM108, but it's enough to be shared among four ladies. The 双椒辣子鸡 costs RM49, which I find a bit overpriced because the chicken cubes are really small and mixed with other ingredients. Based on the taste, I believe they’ve added fried potato cubes, so most of the dish consists of vegetables—mainly two types of chili and potato cubes. The potato is fine to eat, but the chili depends on your spice tolerance.

Service-wise, I was impressed. They have a unique way of calling for staff using a peace ✌🏻 hand sign, which I found interesting (but personally for me as an introverted person, I was really shy to do it). The service team was attentive and had a good attitude.

I might return, but I’d definitely bring at least two more friends to share the portions—if you're a small eater, you won’t be able to finish everything on your own! - 3 weeks ago | (5⭐) Today finally managed to get a chance to dine here after 2 times failed to get in for the past 1 year.

The foods were very good and delicious, white rice was nice, free flow of dried mandarin orange skin tea, hot and ice water are available. Phone charging cable, USB plugs and good quality of tissue paper are provided. Really have nothing to complain and no idea of what to pin point or find fault. Highly and strongly recommend to dine here, no regret! - 3 months ago | (4⭐) Popular chinese sour fish soup spot. Decently great food and their signature taste good. Fish used was normal though and a tad bit oily.

The chicken in spicy 🌶 oil is worth trying whereas the prawns with fen si is savory but a bit oily as well. The veggies was normal but the fried chicken with sweet & sour sauce was worth the try.

Prepare to wait on hols or weekends but they do have a queue system which is good and the service staff will give u a call when it's your turn. - 3 weeks ago | (5⭐) Some may say it is cheap fish but I think it tasted delicious. That’s what matters most, isn’t it? Spices+pepper on point, spicy just the way we like it🫶🏻

Not recommended to order the spicy chicken with chilli pepper, it was expensive and taste was really just so so. The order took a while to come, when we were almost done with our meal.

Tea Garden Restaurant at Sunway Pyramid is an absolute gem for anyone looking for delicious Halal-certified Chinese cuisine with a great variety of dishes. The food was fresh, flavorful, and well-presented, making for an excellent dining experience.

We ordered the fried rice, porridge, and stir-fried radish cake, and every dish was perfectly cooked with the right balance of seasoning. The fried rice was aromatic, packed with shrimp and eggs, while the porridge was silky smooth with crispy shallots and fresh spring onions. The radish cake had a nice crisp exterior with soft, flavorful bites.

The ambiance is warm and inviting, perfect for families and friends. The service was fast and friendly, ensuring we had a pleasant meal. With their Halal certification, this restaurant is a great spot for Muslims who love authentic Chinese flavors.

I saw a customer who had the same chocolate smoothie order as mine. She took a sip, realized it wasn’t the drink she originally ordered, and asked for a replacement. Your staff then replaced the drink for her, but tried to give me the drink that the customer had already taken a sip from. I directly told the staff that I saw the customer drink from it and return it. However, they didn’t make a new drink for me and tried to give me the old one. I felt this was very unethical and unsanitary!

The standard of foot massage was not up to par with the like of full body massage in TO. Acupressure was light, I didn’t get much relief from my tired legs, the therapist’s nails graze my skin on some strokes .  I’ve been to other TO outlets and had both full body aromatherapy and Thai massage many times. I must say this is by far the most disappointing service I received from TO. Not worth of my money.
I also went for leg massage with another competitor (its name starting with “S”) , and it was a great experience! - 8 months ago | (2⭐) The experience was unpleasant!

Came to T.O about 3pm for Traditional Thai Massage, coincidentally have available time slot for this service that I prefer.

But the assigned masseur I think she is new and I can feel that she is unsure about what she’s doing, is like thinking what’s the next sequence. The pressure point and the strength was just okay only…

Didn’t really enjoy the whole massage process and don’t feel relax at all. - a month ago | (4⭐) Please do call for booking as it's always fulled. I want to say thank you to the staff who help massage me. She not just good massager but also very friendly and warm with smile. I like it very much especially your aroma oil.

The store also boasts worktop surfaces that are manufactured from 100% recycled material otherwise destined for the landfill.
The Body Butter Tower: One the most beloved The Body Shop products, The Body Shop body butters are displayed in full glory in a towering rack. With an attached sink, customers can test out different hand wash and shower gels before slathering on their favourite body butter or body lotion at this testing station.

With the establishment of the first London Street Family Park in Malaysia, The Parenthood is a place for the whole family to play and learn together, all under one roof. The flagship outlet is located in Sunway Pyramid and has Indoor Playlands uniquely designed for a fun-filled playtime in a safe yet engaging environment. Emphasising the theme of London Street are familiar architectures such as Big Ben , the red London bus, British flags and red post boxes. Parenthood strives to make your journey enjoyable as it answers to all your children and parental needs with this one-stop edutainment centre.
As of 2019, the Enrichment Hub was introduced which offers a variety of learning programmes, activities, and workshops for children and even parents to have an enjoyable and wonderful time together such as Kids Kick Boxing, Kids Dance Class, Kids Gym, Art & Craft, Robotics and language classes. On top of that, structured classes are also offered here from academic to sports and personal hobbies, all conducted in a safe and positive environment so your children can play and learn while building their self-confidence.
Besides being a playland, The Parenthood also has The Parenthood Preschool located only at the Sunway Pyramid outlet which unlocks your child’s potential beyond education by developing skills in literacy, mathematics, understanding of the world, and expressive Arts & Design.
Parents can also shop for baby care essentials, toys, clothes, stationery and gifts from the wide selection of products by a mix of tenants and baby brands around the park. There is also a restaurant tucked at the corner of the family park where families can indulge in a hearty meal.",SPWF003 (First Floor),"(2⭐) This place is more suitable for older children and not toddler as all the slides are quite high up and the surface not soft enough for toddlers. Furthermore there is a bus area whereby there is some kitchen toys and soft blocks available for play but the condition is very bad, the soft blocks has been chew off and there isn’t much kitchen utensils to play with, only an empty kitchen counter there. Worst still there are many uncovered electric plug points there whereby toddlers will be able to touch it freely, the electric plug point shouldn’t be built there or at least it must be covered up with child protection measures. My young daughter went to play with the switch and i have to constantly tell her not to touch it! This is unacceptable as this is a children playground. Overall this place are more suitable for older kids whereby they can climb higher and know not to touch electric points. There isn’t much things available for toddlers i would say. - in the last week | (5⭐) We celebrated our son’s birthday at Parenthood, and it was an incredible experience! The staff was wonderfully attentive, making sure everything was set up perfectly and that all the kids were having a blast. The play areas were safe, clean, and full of fun activities that kept the kids entertained for hours. They even offered a variety of options for party themes, and the decorations made it feel magical. The food was kid-friendly and tasty, and they took care of every little detail, so we could just relax and enjoy the day with family and friends. Highly recommend Parenthood for any birthday celebration—our son had the best day! - 4 months ago | (5⭐) Came across this huge playground and had the pleasure of trying with my child one weekday.

Entry was swift. Staff are helpful and accommodating. Siligent on cleaning even on a non busy day. It has different play sections, which is good, so older kids will not hurt by accident the younger ones. There are lots of slides, which is fun even for small built adults.

The entrance fee is very reasonable for a whole day play.  About 30 ringgit on weekday / 60 ringgit on weekend, public and school holiday.
Re entry is allowed as long as within that day and with a guardian or parent going in together. Extra guardian or parent is charged 5 ringgit.

Socks is needed to enter like most playgrounds. They charge a reasonable 7 ringgit in case you need it.

There's also a cafe inside where parents could rest while waiting. Opposite the playground is a  shop for kids stuff.

Overall, it's worth it to try. - 6 months ago | (3⭐) A beautifully designed play area for children, with the London bus outside being the most attractive feature! It’s a fun place for kids to explore and enjoy.

However, I felt a little disappointed as the playground space is smaller than last year, and the horse carousel ride is no longer there. The area feels shorter than before, which affects the overall play experience.

One major concern is safety—the staff should keep an eye on kids playing rough, especially on the big slide. Since children of all ages play together, some older kids don’t follow the play rules, making it scary for kids under 7 to enjoy themselves.

Hope the management can improve the playground space and safety monitoring in the future! - in the last week | (5⭐) It was so much fun to be in parenthood lot to do with your kids .

The moment I walked in, I was greeted with a warm and inviting ambiance. The staff were incredibly friendly and attentive, guiding me through their extensive menu and helping me choose the perfect broth and ingredients.

I opted for the spicy mala bowl, and it did not disappoint! The flavors were rich and robust, with just the right amount of heat to keep things exciting. I chose the beef bowl, and the beef slices were thin, delicious, and generously portioned with lots of fresh ingredients. I heard it’s specially made for mala lovers, and I really loved it.

One of the highlights was the Osmanthus Ice Jelly – a must-try! The unique taste of this cool drink was both refreshing and tasty, making it a perfect complement to the hotpot.

Additionally, I would highly recommend the Australian Beef Slice, Pork Slice, and Lamb Slice. All the meat slices were incredibly fresh and enhanced the overall dining experience.

The coffee also came at warm temp not too hot which is ideal.
Had the plain sugar donut, so light just like eating baked flour. I don't think it's anything special given everyone can do donuts these days.
The toasted sourdough sandwiches are pretty decent for the price. Only thing was given only 30% occupied still takes a while to toast. Can't imagine what happens on a packed lunch time.

These premium “yellow” boots set new standards for waterproof performance in the footwear industry. They became equally popular with outdoor enthusiasts who needed protection in all conditions, professional trade workers who needed rugged dependable gear, and many others who just wanted a great looking pair of boots. These boots defined our brand. They were so groundbreaking that in 1978 Timberland renamed the entire company.
Today, Timberland Sunway Pyramid is the go-to place for heavy-duty boots and footwear, fit for all harsh elements and weather conditions. Their signature boots are made with durable premium leather consisting of billions of recycled bottles and plastic, an anti-slip rubber lug outsole and anti-fatigue technology with moulded foam footbed to absorb shock and energy while delivering stability and support. For wet and cold environments, Timberland’s waterproof, water-repellent and insulation technology used in their leather and inner footwear membrane will keep you dry, warm and insulated.
Timberland has also developed numerous technologies for all footwear needs – from lightweight soles for long-lasting cushioning in everyday wear to revolutionary grip stick rubber soles for enhanced traction on different tracks and trails. To keep you dry, protected and warm/cool depending on the weather, Timberland’s all-season apparel packs a punch with their specially designed and tailored fabrics such as water-resistant windbreakers, waterproof parkas, cotton linen shirts, packable hoodies for easy storage, organic cotton shorts and tees, stylish polo tees, print tees, stylish construction jackets and much more. Their ranges are available for both men and women, and adaptable for outdoor and indoor.",G1.28 (Ground Floor),"(5⭐) This timberland store has shifted to another shop lot with a brand new store design.

The food was quite good even if the menu was somewhat limited. I had the Wagyu Burger, and it was not bad at all. The only issue was that it was quite small. The other dishes were fine, though, and the pricing is quite reasonable overall. The ambience of the restaurant is quite nice with a very relaxed and cool vibe to it, especially in the evenings. This makes it a great place for dinner with friends and/or family. Most of the offerings in the menu are western dishes, though, so if you like pizzas, burgers, and pastas, you will like VCR. Recommended! - 2 months ago | (3⭐) Feel quite disappointed with the food, maybe it’s just the things we ordered 🤷‍♀️ The pepperoni pizza has a plastic taste but they were quite generous with the cheese. As for the burgers, suggest to add some greens on the side because overall felt very jelak and not balanced.

Espresso tonic was good 👍 Customer service needs improvement.

The roast pork and char siew is good too. The recent outlet refurbishment made the place more spacious with more seats at the expense of higher prices.

My favourite from this restaurant is there are complimentary soup and gualinko desert.
Tips: Nearby Sunway Pyramid Hotel and recommended when staying at the hotel. - a month ago | (5⭐) Food is served fast and the meals are delicious and flavorful. Newly renovated more dinning capacity but at peak times there's a queue. - 3 weeks ago | (4⭐) It is a smaller branch compare to Mid Valley. But the dishes are as good as Mid Valley. The queueing time for seating is about 20 minutes during peak hour. If you like to chit chat with family members or friends after the dinner, it is not a suitable restaurant due to the compact dinning area and good business.

no one come & approach us when we enter the shop, we go inside & find our own seat.

The food taste so so bad, i don’t recommend anyone to come try it out, but you can try if you want.

the baked cheese pork rice taste so horrible. As u can see from the picture, the rice is not well mixed with the sauce, the texture of the rice is bad as well, weird smell (think they didnt wash the rice properly), the texture of the pork is hard, which i believe it’s a overnight food.

sorry for giving such a bad review, but quality control & taste of the food have to be improved if you want more customer coming in. (this is my honest opinion from my pov, if anyone wanted to try, you are welcome to.) - a year ago | (5⭐) We had lunch here and found the decor pleasant. Food was served soon after ordering.

While RM15.90 isn’t expensive, I’ve dined at other Hong Kong-style restaurants in Pyramid, and they consistently serve generous portions. Unfortunately, this place didn’t meet those standards. Even the hot tea was disappointing.

The culinary landscape in Kuala Lumpur breaks new grounds as the Caffeinees Group of restaurants launches the highly anticipated Yamaguchi Fish Market today, a concept that reimagines the seafood marketplace to serve the freshest catches in town.

Yamaguchi Fish Market is inspired by Karato and Tsukiji Fish Market in Japan where the team sought to bring not only the highest quality and freshest ingredients to seafood lovers but the energetic spirit of the vibrant market as well. The tanks of Yamaguchi Fish Market is filled with fresh catches from seasonal fishes to uni and king crabs that guests can either opt to dine-in and enjoy in a variety of delicious styles or purchase back home at wholesale prices.

Diners will delight in a great variety of fresh-from-the-ocean sashimi and shellfish that the team directly picks up twice a week from the harbour and serve on the extensive and carefully curated menu. Yamaguchi Fish Market’s signature sashimi and grilled seasonal seafood platters is a rich mix of sashimi, shrimps, king crabs, oysters, clams and abalone. For palates of comfort food, the salt baked tai fish, Yamaguchi eel rice and seafood nabemono takes centrestage.
As a marketplace that offers variety in abundance, Yamaguchi Fish Market also takes a local spin onto the ingredients by opening up its menu to offer dishes cooked in local flavors such as salted egg, garlic steam and superior soup.","Suite G-01, The Pinnacle Annexe (Ground Floor)","(3⭐) The worse seafood I have ever eaten!
The lobster in salt is terribly salty. Presentation is nice for everything.
The steam fish is overcook.
The crabs platters only taste of curry powder.

We cannot finished the lobster  because of saltiness.

Definitely won't come back again - 3 months ago | (5⭐) I'm happy with their WhatsApp reservation service. They also provide useful information on price changes on their menu and share promotion meals through WhatsApp.

Finding the shop was a little tricky as it's located beside the Sunway Pinnacle building. You can park your car inside the Sunway Pinnacle to access the next building where the shop is located.

The food quality was excellent. I particularly enjoyed their fish head noodle with crab and clams. The broth was simply delicious. Their signature wine prawns were very fresh, and the wine was super tasty. However, their lala soup was too spicy for me to drink with just a normal spicy level. The crabs were fresh too. I will definitely visit again for their sushi meals. 🍣 - 9 months ago | (4⭐) The second outlet of this restaurant, located in The Pinnacle Annexe, Sunway was opened in April 1, 2022 – the main branch, located in Kampung Pandan was launched in November 2015.
It occupies 2 floors and has lots of seating capacity.  The decoration is rather haphazard, not that it matters when it comes to food and drinks.  The latter I suspect is the main draw come dinner time.
While the menu is extensive (not using the word lightly here!) and mainly promotes Japanese cuisine, there is also a small section catered to Chinese food.  What was a surprise was that they have quite a good range of set lunches as well!  We order the Teppanyaki Beef set, Teppanyaki chicken set, the Sang Hah Mee and a Lala Noodles Soup.  While the lala noodles was just ordinary, both the beef and chicken were pretty good; generous chunks of meat carefully cooked, almost to perfection in teppanyaki sauce.  The dipping sauce completely complemented the meat, being slightly tangy and sweet.  A more familiar chili paste provided some burn, if required. It also came with a plate of rice, edamame, chawanmushi, tofu and miso soup.   The sang hah mee was generous, a large plate of egg noodles drenched with eggy sauce and topped with one very fresh fairly large prawn (into 2 halves).  One is also allowed add-ons, a soup, a drink and dessert at give away prices.  One normally do not expect the add-ons to taste really good, but the mushroom soup was lovely and the ice-lemon tea refreshingly good too!
Although the service is not top notch, who cares when the food, in my opinion is a steal, particularly the sang hah mee.
(Footnote: I recently ate at a “famous” old school sang hah mee stall in the centre of KL and had to pay triple the price for a prawn smaller than the one I had at Yamaguchi.  Even the serving of noodles was more generous!) - a year ago | (1⭐) I visited Yamaguchi Fish Market Restaurant for the Seafood High Tea and was quite disappointed with the food quality. Considering the price(RM102/pax), there are better options available elsewhere. The selection was very limited, with only 14 items to choose from. The salmon sashimi was not fresh, and despite my request for only two of each item, they served the full set. Additionally, drinks were not included in the buffet. The only positive aspect was the food presentation. - 9 months ago | (4⭐) Food super good.

French fare in a spacious hotel lobby setting . Although the menu here is smaller than their main branch in Bangsar, the quality and taste maintains . My partner loved the basket of breads and ordered a 2nd basket . They were generous with the butter and olive oil with balsamic vinegar too . For starters we ordered the soup of the day which was potato and smoked duck, and onion soup . Both were flavourful and not too salty . From the Mains , we ordered duck confit, seafood vol au vent , mushroom risotto with truffle and my favourite steak and frites . My steak was done medium well, just the way I like it. The seafood vol au vent was delicious too although there could have been just a little more sauce in the pastry . The mushroom risotto with truffle is a must try ! Service here is top notch too . All in all, a very good dinner celebration . - 2 years ago | (5⭐) Ordered Egg Mayo Croissant Salmon and Greens (RM29).

Long waiting time during weekend if they did not have spot for 2 person. They will asked if you willing to join table with another customer. Service is fast as not much preparation on their side.

Great spread of premium beef (Angus and Wagyu), seafood, lamb, chicken and sides. Individual BBQ pit with good ventilation exhaust does not leave any odour in the air or on clothes 👍

Service staff were attentive and polite.

Marinated BBQ meats were moist, tender and tasty. Seafood and vegetables could have better been served with some oil/marinade on the side to prevent it from being too dry during BBQ.

Overall nice dining venue and would surely come back again. - 3 months ago | (5⭐) Latest Yakiniku in Sunway Pyramid, I like that I have the option to sit at my own mini table, it remind me of Ichiran ramen solo table. The meat quality especially the beef tongue was better then expected and the miso soup quality was also decent. I recommended people to don't skip order the beef tongue despite there's no set for it. It's quite surprise to know that they provide himalayan pink salt instead of normal salt.

The waiter was very professional and trying to make me feel comfortable. He was patiently explain to me about the menu. I also overheard him explain to an old couple behind me for quite a long time without getting annoyed. Big respect for the waiter patience.

Ordered Hakka noodles which texture and taste was somewhat lacking in that traditional chewiness, aroma and taste of a good old bowl of traditional hakka noodles.

It doesn't taste like Curry Mee and doesn't look like Curry Mee. It looks like Hokkien Prawn mee Soup.. but taste not even near it. No coconut milk at all!

This was the worst Curry Mee i had ever tasted and experience in YiPoh Sunway.

The brand had redefined vegetarian cuisine by experimenting with original flavour and modern techniques, which is a blend of nature and flavoursome. Japanese cuisine is no stranger in Malaysia due to its distinctive tastes, attractive food presentations, and abundance of health benefits. In particular, the Japanese white rice was one of the key factor in contributing to overall health and longevity among the Japanese. The fact that Japanese rice contains a number of well-balanced of nutritional elements such as vegetable protein, dietary fibre, and low in calories. Thus, Japanese white rice being a staple food and pairing with other vegan dishes could promote overall health.
In Zen House, you must try out the Zen signature dishes curated just for you -Volcano Maki, Sashimi Moriawase, Omakase Moriawase, Cheese Shitake, and Zen House special salad. Besides, Zen House has the most creative Japanese vegan menu you can choose from: Appetizers, Salad, Temaki, Makimono, Hosomaki, Nigiri Sushi, Sushi Moriawase, Sashimi, Yakimono, Tempura, Nabemono, Noodles, Donmono, Teppanyaki, and Bento Sets.
As the brand had influenced by the culture of Japan, various vegan ingredients had been used to create a well-balanced Japanese diet. For example, Soba noodles are made up from buckwheat flour and offers beneficial manganese and gluten-free. On the other hand, Udon noodles are made up from thick wheat flour which promote healthy functioning of body cells and enzymes. Both Soba and Udon noodles are ideal for those opting for calorie-conscious diet. Furthermore, those who prefer crunchy texture should try out the wide choices of Vegetable tempura. It is a traditional Japanese style of cooking by deep-frying vegetables coated with light and eggless batter. Another dish that you shouldn’t miss out trying is the Vegan sashimi. The creative fusion of vegetables and other organic ingredients bring out the actual taste of fresh sashimi.

Even bought takeaway after eating in the restaurant. Recommend to eat the food while it is hot! Service was great, slightly pricely but worth it. - 6 months ago | (4⭐) I was delighted to discover this Japanese vegetarian restaurant after browsing a few options at the Sunway Pyramid mall. Finding vegetarian dining options beyond the typical Chinese restaurants can be challenging, so I was pleased to come across this establishment.

For my meal, I ordered an egg roll dish, okra skewer, and kimchi soup ramen. While the okra skewer may not have had the most visually appealing presentation when it arrived at the table, I was pleased to find that the okra was not overcooked. Instead, it maintained a satisfying crunchiness, which is how I prefer my okra to be prepared.

The kimchi ramen was decent overall, though I didn't particularly enjoy some of the ingredients, such as the bean sprouts and cabbage. Personal preferences aside, I appreciated the opportunity to find a suitable vegetarian restaurant option within the Sunway Pyramid mall.

Overall, I'm glad I was able to discover this Japanese vegetarian restaurant, as it provided a refreshing change of pace from the more common Chinese vegetarian offerings in the area. It's always encouraging to see a diverse array of meatless dining options becoming available. - 7 months ago | (5⭐) Wonderful Japanese food for vegetarians!

I went to pick up an online order and unfortunately, there were some hiccups. After showering my order number, the staff went to look for my parcel and said it’s not there. Impossible, because I have a picture of it being delivered. After the second time, they managed to find my parcel. That was the only issue. While waiting for the staff to look for my item, I browsed around and they had a crazy sale. I ended up buying shoes because it was up to 70% off for it! - 3 months ago | (5⭐) Fantastic set up. This is the biggest and the most comprehensive outlet of Adidas. Best Adidas outlet in Malaysia without a doubt. The staffs are all pro-active and very knowledgeable about its products. It has 2 floors. Adidas Performance at the lower floor and Adidas Originals on the upper floor. Widest selection is available here and you get the latest products and customization here too 👍 highly recommended. Well done! - 7 months ago | (1⭐) I was at your adidas branch on the 26th of January on Sunday. Went there to purchase & customize a Jersey. STAFF no. 1 served me and went to confirm with the customization team which letters and numbers were available in stock. After confirming, STAFF no. 1 said that ONLY THE LETTER A was not in stock so he recommended me to purchase the letter at the Liverpool store opposite of adidas ( apparently he said that adidas customers do that when adidas runs out of letters or numbers ) So I went and purchase the letter A at the Liverpool store and went back to adidas to finally purchase the jersey. When I came back to the store I was served by STAFF NO. 2. STAFF NO. 2 brought me to the customization area to confirm the customization after I had told them the story of me purchasing the letter A. When I was at the customization counter suddenly the customization staff now said NUMBER 1 is also out of stock? To add another plot twist to the story after going back and forth with the staffs there, the same customization staff that initially SAID THE LETTER A and NUMBER 1 was unavailable suddenly said THE LETTER S is also out of stock when I showed him the player’s name and number for the second time? And what would have happened and how would it have been resolved if I went to the Liverpool store again and purchased the number 1 only for the hopeless customization staff to say that now the letter S is also out of stock? :D
( Do note that In the midst of encountering all these 3 incompetent staff and me going back and forth purchasing the unavailable letter at a different store I already showed them the Name and Number I wanted to put on the Jersey ) I don’t usually get triggered or mad at things like this as I am also working as a retail staff and I know how fussy certain customers can get sometimes but honestly it was your staffs fault for handing out wrong information over and over again. Wouldn’t it just be settled if any of the 3 staff actually would have just told me which letter and number was unavailable in the first place? Hence, today was probably the dumbest customer service I’ve encountered in my years of being a customer.

On a happy note, another Female customization staff was working on that day but she was at the upper floor as she was in charge of the redemption counter on that day ( based on the information given to me ) she was the one who apologized and insisted on reimbursing me for the initial letter A that I purchased. Kudos to her for helping out in settling the matter as the other Male customization staff kept laughing and saying that “I don’t know” a million times throughout the whole issue. Felt bad that she was the one who had to take out money from her own pocket when it was the initial 3 useless staff that caused the whole problem with their wrong information to begin with.

According to the female staff, she said that the customization team and the retail team aren’t linked together. So my opinion / suggestion is for both side to get correct information beforehand so something stupid like this does not happen again because it’s quite troublesome for your customers when each staff is giving out a different story every time. - a month ago | (1⭐) Had a sales guy ( Ashraf? Not sure how to spell his name) , we wanted to purchase 2 shirts, then he tried to force us to buy a pair of sneakers (???) coz was on discount, even though we said the shoes were not to our fitting and liking.

When we went to pay for the shirts, he got angry when we refused to purchase the shoes, gave an angry stare down,

Semi threw a tantrum ... gave the cashier his sales ID and walked off on a big huff.

😅Dude...don't scold customer lah if you can't hit your sales target...wuuuttt. - a month ago | (5⭐) Myself and my husband were browsing Adidas online store and there were few unique edition which has limited unit and size. We contacted several outlets and I would say Sunway Pyramid customer service is top notch from staff name Anis.

Not much of a serious coffee drinker; taste different from normal; amazing fragrance and deep taste. Enjoyed the coffee and ambience. Great port of call away from the busy mall scene outside. - 3 months ago | (5⭐) A very unique spot tucked away, offering a peaceful escape from the busy mall atmosphere. The coffee was fantastic – rich and full of flavor. However, found the chocolate roll to be a bit underwhelming, as it lacked the depth of flavors I was hoping for. Overall, it’s a great place to unwind with a good cup of coffee. - 3 weeks ago | (4⭐) I love the ambience of the place, very unique and is based on Japanese anime. The staffs were very friendly and helpful. They have desserts and drinks so I ordered the dark chocolate cake and a fujisan drink. Honestly, the dessert is just average but I like their drink. It is slightly pricey and the place is small but it's a good place for those who want to do quick office work. - 5 months ago | (5⭐) A cozy and quiet coffee shop hidden away in a busy mall. The coffee selection was great and I really enjoyed my cup! Great place to sit down and relax in the midst of a busy mall. Will visit again and definitely recommend to others. - 2 months ago | (5⭐) Price is on the higher end, the coffee was very good but a little too sour for my own preference, match latte was perfect.

1. Spring Roll Vermicelli - RM17.90
2. Rice Pork Chop - RM 19.90
3. Plain Water - RM1.20

Total with 16% tax = RM45.25

Overall the foods are served with normal Vietnamese food standard. Not too bad also not super good.

Portion is enough. Simple meal. - in the last week | (5⭐) It’s my first time to visit. The food tastes good to me because it’s not too spicy. The Vietnamese bread is a bit hard, but the grilled pork chop inside tastes good. I like the soup to be hot enough but not too heavy on MSG. I love the lemongrass and ginger tea with its strong ginger flavor. Spicy, the service staff are very polite, especially the male waiter at the cash register. He deserves praise for his politeness and patience. The overall meal is enjoyable and delicious to me. - 3 months ago | (5⭐) Came here for lunch on weekday, quite packed during lunch hour.

Their food is very good is all i can say, i did not have high expection for this place but wow. Everything is just good, even their service is good also. One thing that let me down is their Iced Dripped Coffee is not that strong. I wish they would let us enjoy the dripping process and allow us to pour into the cup ourselves to adjust the thickness and flavour we want.

Will come again for sure - a month ago | (4⭐) Visited twice, the first visit was a great experience, food was served quickly despite it was full house on a weekend. Food portion was big, and tasted delicious. Recommend the avocado coffee, we requested for less sugar and it was yummy.

Second visit was quite a let down. We ordered the banh mi pork chop, but the pork had a very strong strange taste, it’s the taste everybody is afraid of when eating pork. We couldn’t even finish.

I will return to this restaurant but I might not order pork dishes anymore - 2 months ago | (4⭐) We came here for our reunion lunch, oh gosh their beef balls really gave my sis and i a huge surprise! Both of our first visit and we were so in love with their beef balls! Lemon grass drinks definitely not our taste…… Gonna try out their pillow rice balls on our next visit. - a month ago",Ăn Viet @ Sunway Pyramid | Vietnamese Food Restaurant,+60 3-5611 2226,"Monday: 11:00 AM – 9:30 PM, Tuesday: 11:00 AM – 9:30 PM, Wednesday: 11:00 AM – 9:30 PM, Thursday: 11:00 AM – 9:30 PM, Friday: 11:00 AM – 9:30 PM, Saturday: 10:00 AM – 9:30 PM, Sunday: 10:00 AM – 9:30 PM"
