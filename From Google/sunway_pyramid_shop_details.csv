This lead to a wild spread rebellion spread across the nation. The founders of this food establishment found the best Asian fried chicken, believe or not, in New York’s city on the subway scene. This is where it all began. Their original chicken recipe is more well-known have a fiery sensation which is as intense as their hot and spicy sauce. From there on, they spread their wings to other regions such as Malaysia, Indonesia and Australia to share what they believed.
How do they make their chicken taste so good? Their chicken is specially cooked to using their own house recipe which resulted in an awesome fried chicken that's packed with loads of flavour. They also use only fresh, locally sourced free-range chicken in kitchens which definitely speaks of quality of their own food. What makes their chicken recipe unique, spicy and crispy, it is cooked with natural herbs and spices, with zero artificial flavourings. In addition to that there is no MSG and instead they use naturally fermented soy sauces that packs a punch, offering their food in the most natural way possible.
Their signature Soy Garlic and Hot & Spicy sauces are made the good old fashioned way, fermented naturally using a traditional Asian method (soy beans, water, 5 months of Malaysian sun) and natural herbs and spices. Not only their chicken is great but they also offer a variety of things such as their delicious burgers and sandwiches, seafood and salad to appeal to many. Now that is available in our mall, this is a great addition for everyone to enjoy a chicken recipe originated from Singapore. Come and try it out!",LG2.127 (Lower Ground 2 Floor)

If you’re on a shopping spree, you won’t want to skip this super cute store that has so much to offer that it’s established itself as ‘a girl’s favourite shopping destination’. Hailing from its headquarters in Hong Kong, the brand started out as a youthful and energetic lingerie brand founded by Erik Ryd, a Swedish entrepreneur with a well-known lingerie manufacturing business in Asia. A few years later, the brand expanded its range of apparel from its adorable to sexy lingerie line, to include nightwear, active wear, denim, tops, dresses, pants, loungewear and accessories.
As this shopping haven expands to become one of the fastest-growing fashion brands in Asia, it now has more than 200 outlets and counting all over. Lion is proud to say that the brand’s first outlet on Malaysian shores opened right here at Sunway Pyramid in 2019! When they first opened their doors to all fashion-adoring shoppers, Lion was curious to find out what the intriguing name of their store meant. Turns out, the meaning behind 6IXTY8IGHT’s unique name has its roots in Chinese numerology. Since Cantonese is the main dialect spoken in Hong Kong, their pronunciation for the numbers 6 and 8 have phonetic similarities to a phrase resembling “Forever luck!”.
There’s definitely something for everyone here. With their wide range of lingerie that’s either cute and quirky, or sexy and alluring, it’s amazing how comfortable and affordable it is too - who ever said you can’t have the best of both worlds? Even their outerwear is nothing short of stylish chic, great to mix and match for every occasion – whether it’s that perfect date outfit, or for a day out with friends, or even to your office.

If you look different that doesn't mean you are different from others finally what matters is your character. A stranger can't judge you by your appearance. No matter your age or gender, your body’s largest organ is your skin. If you want your skin especially on the face to look its best and stay healthy, you need to take care of it. Healthy, good looking skin begins with skin care. Facials are an essential ingredient of your overall skin care program and you will love the benefits of facials. A facial is a spa therapy and massage that leaves your skin cleaner, softer, younger, and truly transformed. Facials can help clear clogged pores, quench parched skin and remove dead cells. Facials involve some massage which aids in blood circulation and lymphatic drainage. The facial massage also helps to relax facial muscles which can slow the onset of wrinkles on the face. Puffiness reduction, sagging in the face and skin cell renewal are additional benefits from these massage techniques. Facials help reduce the impact of sun exposure, smoking and other environmental factors as well as incorrect product use. During your facial, your licensed aesthetic, will recommend appropriate skin care for home use to help you continue the benefits of our facial and correct ongoing skin care issues. Adonis, with natural skin care, you don’t have to worry about the added chemicals you aren’t sure are safe. Natural ingredients can help protect against the sun and soothe irritated skin, so they are better for the skin overall as long as you choose the right products for your skin needs.

Traditional favorites have long ingrained itself into the taste bud of every person, regardless of which social class you are in, be it the rich man and his craving for the decadent roadside Ramly burger or a simple office worker looking forward to a hearty lunch of char koey teow.
Ah Cheng Laksa is one of those establishments that brings out the best in a local delicacy and transport the eater on a journey away from the stress of the day. Offering a varied menu of local mains and side dishes, the main item to stand out is the infamous laksa (it IS in the name after all, in case anyone is wondering)! With their secret inhouse blend of spices for the laksa soup base, they have elevated the aromatic taste of the dish to new levels of tastiness. For an added twist, customers are encouraged to add the pungent ‘otak udang’ sauce, which is a black paste made from prawn innards to give a special zest to the flavor. Adventurous customers can add some squeezed lime juice and fried onions to the soup, creating a memorable sensation that is hard to forget.
To bolster the delicious laksa, the menu also carries fried chicken meat rolls, more commonly known as the ‘lobak’, which compliments the laksa’s taste. The presence of a meaty dish gives the meal a hearty and filling feel, which may be lacking from just the laksa alone, as the sour-ish soup stimulates the appetite further as you enjoy your meal.
End your meal with a fine dessert, be it a ‘rojak’ or the infamous ABC, every day is a good day at Ah Cheng Laksa!",LG2.88 (Lower Ground 2 Floor)

This was the birthplace of Arabian Oud. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz Al Jasser founded the store with one mission – to source and expertly blend the best oils and scents in the world. This uncompromising dedication to quality still guides the brand today. Arabian Oud has grown from its origins in the Alzal souk to become the largest Arabian fragrance house in the world. We have taken our oriental perfumes and oils, sourced and blended from the finest ingredients, to international markets, gaining many loyal fans as we have expanded. Today we boast over 900 stores worldwide, and our unique, luxurious perfumes are worn by customers from more than 36 countries worldwide. The most highly-prized ingredient of a perfumer’s palette, oud is said to be the first pure incense found on earth. Derived from dark resin found in the trunk of centuries old Aquilaria trees, this unique perfume has a cultural and religious significance dating back to ancient civilisations. Oud has a deep woody scent that persists and evolves over the whole day. Our team of oud hunters practice unwritten rites handed down from generation to generation. Native to southeast Asia, the rare, resinous heartwood forms in the trunks and roots of trees infected with a parasitic mould. Our oud hunters work tirelessly to source and harvest the finest Agarwood, while respecting the delicate balance of nature to conserve this scarce prize for future generations. Our dedicated team of world renowned perfumers and bottle designers promise perfection in every blend. Using their wealth of experience, they sensitively combine exquisite ingredients in beautiful bottles to showcase the very finest in oriental perfumery.

Business was especially brisk during festive seasons for this high-quality traditional delicacy, which Mr Teo Swee Ee introduced as ‘bakkwa’. Through his passion for calligraphy and divination, he created the Bee Cheng Hiang brand name, 美珍香. Each character is composed with nine calligraphic strokes, signifying brand longevity and a representation of the Bee Cheng Hiang experience. Today, the brand has spread across many parts of the world, including our very own Sunway Pyramid!
Visitors to their shops are treated to the sight, smell and taste of our products. Unchanged since 1933, their recipe retains the traditional taste, and is uncompromising in quality. Each bakkwa are still hand crafted, over traditional bamboo sieves. That’s why no two pieces are the same. The meat is smoked for hours over the slow burning flames of charcoal.
Bee Cheng Hiang is more than just a ‘bakkwa’ company. Their Vision is to be Asia’s leading food company: providing quality products and services to the global market. In a world where food safety is of utmost importance, customers can enjoy their products with a peace of mind. Each bakkwa are made with 100% natural ingredients, without added meat tenderizer, preservatives, artificial flavouring or colouring and MSG.
This has remained true since their inception in 1933 and remains true today. Today, with more than 370 outlets in 12 territories, Bee Cheng Hiang is still committed to their core mission to be the best at helping people to experience and share enjoyable moments in everyday life.",LG2.58A (Lower Ground 2 Floor)

Rare and highly desired, they range from beautiful shades of creamy white to deep gold, with shades of yellow and champagne falling in between. Pearls that have a deeper golden colour are considered more valuable, such as how the deepest golden colour, being referred to as 24 karat, is said to be the most valuable colour for South Sea pearls.

FILA gained global attention for its instantly recognisable tennis apparel in the 1970s, and has since expanded their design portfolio to include sporting apparel across a wide range of codes including golf, training, running and compression wear.
While their technical processes are at the forefront of sporting design, the brand remains true to its time-honoured European aesthetic and outfits professional artists and athletes from around the world.
A century after its inception, FILA has become synonymous with both sport and sophistication, worn by world-renowned professional athletes as well as fashion-conscious individuals.
Collaborations with luxury fashion houses and influential designers have captured the attention of the fashion world, and the premium lifestyle sports brand continues to make its mark to this day.

What was previously worn as an essential beachwear, has now become an icon of fun, fashion and casualness that will accompany you no matter how far your feet take you. With over 50 years of history in the footwear retailer industry, this Brazilian brand’s first pair was actually based on the traditional Japanese Zori sandals which use rice straw to create the soles. How the brand makes its flit flops and sandals iconic is by it trademark design, creating the texture of their rubber soles to appear like rice grains. Even before crossing international borders, the brand first gained recognition from foreign countries when tourists would love to them home as gifts, or even to sell in their home country. Havaianas’ footwear isn’t just iconic, it gives you top quality to match its reputation, claiming that their flit flops and sandals don’t lose their shape, don’t smell and their straps don’t come loose. Over the years, the brand has evolved and adapted with trends, which led to the birth of new footwear from them, including sneakers and espadrilles to cater to fans who live in countries with climates that require something warmer than flit flops. Translating the rubber flit flops into the soles of the sneaker showcases how the brand retains its symbolic feature into its latest creations. Havaianas constantly brings you fresh designs featuring eye-catching colours, fun prints, and even special collections (like their Frozen 2 range!).

Medifeet creates super-cushioning, conforming, and comfortable shoes with varying medical, therapeutic, corrective, protective, user-friendly, and supportive features built-in or inserted-in to fix all foot problems. Medifeet started-out humbly with only dealers and no retail shops but in just over 5 years they have grown to 34 branches throughout Malaysia, including in Sunway Pyramid.

It’s what’s on the inside that counts MEDIFEET as a high technology designed to feel like clouds—soft, ultralite, swaddling your feet like baby and it all begins right beneath your feet.
Our footbeds and shoe designs are carefully engineered using the finest materials like high-grade memory padding, contoured orthotic systems to create a cushion that molds to your feet and absorbs the shock of all those steps you’re taking. They’re anatomically shaped to help spread weight evenly for a comfortable stride, and in many cases, our footbeds are even removable specially made for diabetics. Just replace with a new one or a custom orthotic to kick up the walkability of your MEDIFEET in seconds.
Taking care of your feet is our priority, as we know FEET IS OUR SECOND HEART!
Medifeet emphasizes on building-in health and comfort components into health shoes while maintaining the beauty aspect. Upon working closely with their podiatrist, Medifeet has their very own creation, the innovative Orthotic System, which when used with our readymade range helps make the semi-custom-made range possible.
The Orthotic System comprises insole support built-ins according to individual needs such as their built-in with arch support for solving flat feet problems. Their Spine Guard using Japanese technology and 3-point support built-in inside shoes are examples of their other 6-7 technologies.

Curious about why would anyone purchase insoles, he began to journey to understand more on shoes and leg pain problems. During abroad, he obtained the principle of bio-dynamics, helping him to further understand insoles and their purpose. He began trying different insoles on himself.
After 6 months, he realized that his own knee problems have improved. Since then, he decided to venture into the making of insole business – MyFeet. He imported digital scanning machines from Korea to analyse customers feet problems and custom made insoles that solve their feet problems. After many years of analysing, feet problems can be categorized into a flat arch, high arch, bowleg, knock knee, overpronation, and supination. These problems will lead to an imbalance of body biodynamics, causing stress on the rest of the body such as foot pain, knee pain, and back pain.
Mr. Wong created MyFeet to help more people to solve pains caused by the feet. The sandals in MyFeet Sunway Pyramid are carefully engineered using the finest materials like high-grade memory foam, shaped and moulded to fit each wearer feet condition.

1888 was the year Obermain began creating quality shoes and boots in Burgkunstadt, a town on the Upper Main River whose leather goods were sought by elite professionals in turn of the century Germany. Burgkunstadt’s legacy of craftsmanship and material excellence lives on today – in shoes, bags, and accessories designed by Obermain to continue our proud tradition.
Obermain invites men and women to step into a new kind of comfort, the kind that overcomes outdated compromises that pit form versus function, wearability versus appeal, and tradition versus modernity. Where quality workmanship and materials assure durability. Where special comfort features make every step – leisurely on brisk, on carpet or concrete – lighter, softer, more flexible, and more secure. Where style means a contemporary touch and updated details that set you at ease weekdays and weekends. The perfect union of quality, comfort, and style. Obermain is made for striding with confidence through every walk of life.
We design our products to be loved and used for a long time. We may apply classic silhouettes or re-interpret them with a twist. If we do this, we must keep the shoe silhouette recognizable. We are not slaves to fashion, yet we may adapt trends as touches of modernity—subtly and tastefully.
“OBERMAIN = PROFESSIONALS”………..…..Who value quality, expecting total comfort from their daily attire. They are the reason and the inspiration for everything Obermain stands for Elegant | Refined | Confident | Smart | Urban I Sophisticated | Intelligent | Charming",LG1.80 (Lower Ground 1 Floor)

Having launched its ecommerce business in Singapore in 2017, the brand was known for its premium value gaming monitors that offered the best performance at wallet-friendly prices. Following its success in the gaming space, the brand then launched its own brand of Android TVs, which it is best known for today.

In 2021, PRISM+ brought its brand of direct-to-consumer ecommerce business model to Malaysia to great reception. The brand’s introduction of its 86” Android TV, the Q86 PRO-QE, shook the market for large screen TVs at never-before-seen prices. – and quickly became the top-selling Android TV and Monitor brands in e-commerce. Since then, the brand has moved from strength-to-strength and is now looking to venture beyond its ecommerce origins with its very first experiential store at Sunway Pyramid. Its store in Sunway Pyramid is the first of its kind outside of Singapore, which launched its first physical stores in August 2022, and sees the brand name Malaysia as a key market for its growth. Not forgetting its gaming roots, PRISM+ has also partnered with Logitech to offer gaming peripherals at its offline store, as part of its commitment in offering customers a holistic experience. The brand will continue to expand its offerings in Malaysia, with the Sunway Pyramid store serving as a physical touchpoint for its fans to experience its latest product launches. As the first physical store in Malaysia, PRISM+ at Sunway Pyramid is a signal of ambition from the fast-growing consumer electronics brand as it gears towards its next big move. In Singapore, the brand recently announced its first smart home appliance, the PRISM+ Zero, and has teased that it will move in the same direction in Malaysia – while continuing to offer the best deals for Android TVs, productivity, and gaming monitors and more.

‘Reef since 1984’ is more than just a date on a timeline.
It’s a symbol of our passion that compels us to bring people the absolute best footwear products in the world. What drives us to reimagine, redefine and redesign everything we know about sandals, and do that again, and again, and again.
It’s the pride we have in ourselves and what we’ve stood for since day 1 – delivering the freedom of surf life through expertly crafted experiences.
It’s having long lasting trust in our partners to bring our brand to life in the most authentic way possible and working together through whatever the world throws our way.
‘Reef since 1984’ is more than just a number. It’s who we are.
In 1984, two entrepreneurial brothers from South America named Fernando and Santiago Aguerre founded REEF out of a love for the beach and surfing.Their idea was to create high-quality, super comfortable products that fit the lifestyle they loved.
Fernando and Santi walked everywhere, so they created sandals that could take them to the beach, into town and wherever they wanted to go – in comfort.
The brothers redefined, redesigned and reengineered every component of the sandal. That attention to detail and an uncompromising standard of quality made Reef the most comfortable sandals anybody had ever worn.
The innovations that started in 1984 have evolved into the Reef sandals we love today, becoming a symbol of a free, comfortable and happy lifestyle.",LG2.K11 (Lower Ground 2 Floor)

In 2016 Smiggle said hello to Malaysia, Hong Kong & Ireland! It's all part of the grand plan to be the world's most exciting and famous stationery brand.
Smiggle’s product range is exclusively designed in Melbourne, Australia, and the range is now bigger and better than ever, with the team at the Smiggle Design Lab drawing inspiration from all over the globe!

Being the first world class ice sports entertainment in Malaysia where you can enjoy a day of ice-skating to escape the heat of Kuala Lumpur, Sunway Pyramid Ice has played host to numerous international sports competitions and musicals since 1997. With a rink size spanning 39m x 22.5m, shoppers can have a breathtaking view of this ice-skating rink's sleek-modern design from above thanks to glass panels surrounding each level. On and off, you can catch a sight of experienced skaters practising their routines and perfecting their stunts, as Sunway Pyramid Ice is part of ISIAsia (Ice Skating Institute Asia), which trains professional figure-skaters in Malaysia.
Spend only a total of RM20 on weekdays, RM25 on weekends and RM28 during school and public holidays to enjoy the ice-skating rink as much as you like. Although it is a prerequisite to wear gloves and socks when ice-skating, these items are readily available at the ticketing counter for RM6 and RM9 respectively.
It is the birth place where many local skating talents are born and trained by Sunway Pyramid Ice very own coaches through its Skating Academy. Beginners without skating knowledge may opt to take up 30 minute lessons with rates starting at RM70 on weekdays and RM75 on weekends. As you get better in your ice-skating skills, advance lessons may then be an option. This could be a good opportunity for children and young teens to pick up a new skill during school holidays with packages and interesting discounts for classes. Due to its close proximity to Petaling Jaya’s many five-star hotels, universities and colleges, as well as the Sunway Lagoon Theme Park, Sunway Pyramid Ice can get very crowded during the weekends, so it is highly recommended for customers to arrive early to avoid the long queue.",B1 (Basement 1)

The Body Shop’s new Activist Makers’ Workshop store is a place for play and discovery, where shoppers can get stuck in and get inspired by the brand’s legendary beauty products and ethical purpose.
Customers of the new store will experience new features at this The Body Shop store, one of the most sustainable in Malaysia:
Refill station: The Body Shop is on a mission to use as little plastic as possible with aluminium refill bottles that can be cleaned and brought back to the store to be refilled from 12 of the brand’s best-loved shower gel, shampoo, conditioner and hand wash.
Sustainable store fixtures: The store has been outfitted with sustainable fixtures made from reclaimed wood and recycled plastics to help minimise its environmental footprint. Examples include a metal facade constructed in aluminium, which requires less energy production than other materials and is infinitely recyclable. The store also boasts worktop surfaces that are manufactured from 100% recycled material otherwise destined for the landfill.
The Body Butter Tower: One the most beloved The Body Shop products, The Body Shop body butters are displayed in full glory in a towering rack. With an attached sink, customers can test out different hand wash and shower gels before slathering on their favourite body butter or body lotion at this testing station.
The ACT Wall/Station: This is where brand campaigns and values are shared to customers to create positive engagement with them. From our environmental causes to women empowerment, this wall will be a place to advocate our values.

They have been since the very beginning. Stepping outside in any kind of weather was a problem Timberland was born to solve. In 1973 our original waterproof boots called the “Timberland” were invented. They were rugged, well-crafted, and—thanks to an innovative injection moulding technique which was new to the footwear industry—they withstood the elements.
These premium “yellow” boots set new standards for waterproof performance in the footwear industry. They became equally popular with outdoor enthusiasts who needed protection in all conditions, professional trade workers who needed rugged dependable gear, and many others who just wanted a great looking pair of boots. These boots defined our brand. They were so groundbreaking that in 1978 Timberland renamed the entire company.
Today, Timberland Sunway Pyramid is the go-to place for heavy-duty boots and footwear, fit for all harsh elements and weather conditions. Their signature boots are made with durable premium leather consisting of billions of recycled bottles and plastic, an anti-slip rubber lug outsole and anti-fatigue technology with moulded foam footbed to absorb shock and energy while delivering stability and support. For wet and cold environments, Timberland’s waterproof, water-repellent and insulation technology used in their leather and inner footwear membrane will keep you dry, warm and insulated.
Timberland has also developed numerous technologies for all footwear needs – from lightweight soles for long-lasting cushioning in everyday wear to revolutionary grip stick rubber soles for enhanced traction on different tracks and trails. To keep you dry, protected and warm/cool depending on the weather, Timberland’s all-season apparel packs a punch with their specially designed and tailored fabrics such as water-resistant windbreakers, waterproof parkas, cotton linen shirts, packable hoodies for easy storage, organic cotton shorts and tees, stylish polo tees, print tees, stylish construction jackets and much more.
