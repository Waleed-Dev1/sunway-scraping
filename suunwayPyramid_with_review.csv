They offer a great selection of sports shoes, caps, sandals, water bottles, and socks. The store is well-organized, and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Whether you're into running or just need casual sportswear, this place has plenty of high-quality options. Definitely worth a visit! | review_rating:5, text:I visited Running Lab at Sunway Pyramid today, and the store absolutely deserves my 5 star review! I had the pleasure of being assisted by En. Ahmad Ridzwan, who provided exceptional service. As a runner himself, he understood my needs perfectly and recommended running shoes that suited me the best. What impressed me the most was his suggestion to try the shoes on a treadmill to ensure the right fit - a thoughtful touch that truly sets this store apart. En. Ahmad's deep knowledge of the products and his friendly, encouraging attitude made the experience unforgettable.

When the size we wanted was out of stock, En. Ahmad went above and beyond to source it from other branches for us. His dedication and willingness to help were truly outstanding.

I've been to several Running Lab branches before, but I've never encountered someone as dedicated and knowledgeable as En. Ahmad. I am so glad I decided to visit this branch today! Both my sister and I ended up making purchases, and we left feeling completely satisfied.

Thank you Running Lab Sunway Pyramid, and especially En. Ahmad Ridzwan, for such a fanstatic experience. Highly recommended for anyone looking for expert advice and top-notch service! | review_rating:5, text:I had a great experience visiting the store for the first time.

It was already dinner time for us all. We didn’t want any Chinese nor Western food . So we walked around the restaurants here to pick n choose what best to eat. So my niece who is rather adventurous , wanted to try some Indonesian food. We also happened to pass by this restaurant called Bebek Goreng Pak Ndut that serves duck n chicken cuisine Indonesian style. So we took a table n ordered our dinner. We ordered 2 pax of grilled duck n original duck plus another 2 pax of crispy fried chicken n grilled chicken. The food, to our surprise, was good . The prices were also reasonable. There were some Malay as well as some Chinese customers too. After our dinner when we left , we saw their special promotions during weekdays from 2.30pm - 5.30 pm. | review_rating:4, text:The duck is crispy outside and soft and fluffy inside thus making it very delectable. The grilled duck is the best IMO.

There is an assortment of condiments that are available and it's unlimited. A delight especially for spice lovers. | review_rating:3, text:Plenty of seats to choose. Ordered the fried duck. Nothing to shout about. It's too dry for my liking. At least the sambal provides a good cover. The cracker also not all is crunchy.

So, overall it's just mid. | review_rating:4, text:Food (Bebek Goreng/Bakar) - it is good as expected and definitely value for money. Perhaps just change the raw cabbage with some other veggies that can be eaten raw by most people.

Food (Beef soto betawi) - This was my original order but I asked to cancel because the beef was tough (tougher than your bully brother lol). Like real tough, plus the ligaments of the meat is everywhere. 😂 I asked to change to bebek goreng.

Service - This is Awesome! Overall the crew was kind and nice. One of the crew even ask me to do this review, which I don’t want to. Haha but he insisted so that they can continue to improve!

It's a lil bit hidden but it's right next to a lift. Do note that this place is self-serve so it's not your usual mamak where the waiter will come to serve you. Since the staff's number are a lil bit limited, it might take a while if you're ordering food that need some cooking (mi goreng mamak etc.) If you're looking for something filling (and you want it fast), I would recommend you to order their nasi campur. The payment method here are by card, duitnow qr (you have to scan their duitnow qr) and also cash. The location has some echo to it, so you might have to speak louder when ordering your food/chatting with you companions.

Tried the spicy & black garlic ones..., Both were equally delicious. Worth repeating if the soupy craving hit me again.

Also tried the fried dumplings. It was edible.. not too bad but I wished they fried it properly. So it's nice and crispy

Service was nothing to write about. It's neither good nor bad. Unmemorable actually.

Food was served in reasonable time, considering I was in my  hangry mode. | review_rating:4, text:I recently visited Ramen Matsuri and ordered the Black Garlic Special Ramen. The dish was superb—packed with rich, bold flavors, and the ramen itself had that perfect stringy texture I love. The broth was delicious and well-balanced, making every bite enjoyable.

However, I’m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I noticed the staff brought out the rubbish bin through the front door in front of customers, which wasn’t ideal. Apart from that, everything else was fantastic! Definitely worth a visit for the ramen alone.

The food are served hot and fast, services are good too! | review_rating:5, text:One of my favourite places to get simple ramen. I usually get the Torikoku Original, which is a ramen dish with lightweight but flavourful chicken broth. They're always super generous on the chicken - they're so thick and big, and I'd struggle to finish everything unless I'm absolutely starving.

I also love the black fungus topping - it adds a nice crunch, and they give plenty of chopped green things (don't know what it is but it adds nice flavour).

I love the noodles they use too. They're nice and thin, and never undercooked or overcooked. They always taste on point. The chicken broth tastes best hot (always served hot anyway) and is great for rainy days.

I'm surprised it's almost always empty when I come here haha. I think the price charged for the quality of food is very reasonable. I hope more people will come here more often because I don't want one of my favourite ramen places to close down...I haven't found any other place that serves ramen like this 🙏🙏🙏

For a family of five, we spent $700 AUD—absolutely not worth it. There are so many better places in Malaysia to visit for a fraction of the cost. Even with a quick pass, there was no need to wait for rides, which only made the purchase feel like a scam. The photos online are misleading, so don’t fall for the marketing.

It take very long time for them to serve. Second point is the Asam fish head not fresh for the fish head. Got one smell, and the fish got a lot of scale. The only the I feel is nice is the coconut rice smells good and taste delicious. This is the thing you can try.
Overall this visit is unpleasant. Cause other table already serving and we keep waiting almost 40/45 mins. We order around 9 dishes, yet nothing come first. Till we complain with the waiter only one of the ladies apologise. In the end there is a guy waiter who see us very unhappy and provide us the desert cendol.

We had dumpling soup, glass noodles with soft shell crab and otak-otak fried rice.

The dumpling soup is a delightful blend of flavours and textures. The minced prawn and chicken filling in the dumplings is succulent and well seasoned, providing a savoury bite with each spoonful. The broth is light yet flavourful, perfectly complementing the dumplings.

The claypot glass noodles with soft shell crab is a dish that truly standout. The glass noodles are stir fried in dark soy sauce, giving them a rich and umami flavour. The highlight, of course, is the soft shell crab, which is cooked to perfection. The crab is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, adding a delightful crunch to the dish. The combination of textures and flavours makes this a must try.

Lastly, the otak-otak fried rice is a unique and flavourful dish. The rice is perfectly cooked and infused with the distinct taste of otak-otak, a special fish cake. The dish is well balanced and not overly spicy, making it enjoyable for a wide range of palates. It’s a creative twist on traditional fried rice that is sure to impress. | review_rating:5, text:You must dine at Madam Kwan’s at Sunway Pyramid. The Satay is the best i have tasted in my lifetime!

We just had to order a second plate of the Salted Fish Fried Rice ! The Nasi Bojari is also the best so far. These dishes were recommended by their staff Ika who is very  friendly and her customer service is unparalleled!  We ended our meal with another recommendation by Ika - Fritters with Ice Cream.

I went to the G floor branch (next to Parkson).

The first time I went to counter 1 to change A currency, I said I wanted to split two receipts, he said he couldn’t split the transaction and asked me to queue up again.

OK, Second time I went to counter 1 again (only 1 counter is open) and changed A currency.

Seeing that there was no one in line behind me, I said I wanted to change B currency, he said no, he could only change money from one country per person at a time, which means I had to wait until someone came to queue up to change money before I could change money for the third time?

Meanwhile counter 2 is open, then I pointed to counter 2 and asked if I could change money, counter 1 said NO, because counter 2 is new and he didn’t know how to do it.

First, they doesn't seems very familiar with the name of the drink on the reserved menu. They need to double check on the menu to confirm what's really customer mentioned when place order.

Secondly, the ticket doesn't place / stick well to the drinks producing counter. It caused that no barista noticed that there are a pending order to make (reserve coffee menu). After all, they keep calling customer name while food ready but nobody making the drink.

At the end,  the drink has served finally, but as photo shown, been ordered a Reserve menu coffee, but served without the Starbucks Reserve black sleeve and the complimentary chocolate. Definitely not well trained enough.

Then I saw a barista served the food over to a female customer to her table but forgot the drink itself. The female customer has to get up and go over the waiting section to get the drink by herself after all.

From the beginning, I felt something was off, but I didn’t expect to be left so frustrated by the end of the session. The technician didn’t inform me that she was a trainee until the very end, which would have been helpful to know upfront. The lack of experience was painfully evident throughout the entire process.

The session took over 2 and a half hours, which I found completely unnecessary, especially since I was only getting a basic gel manicure with no color. I had specifically asked for nail extensions prior, but I was told that they would take too long. However, even with just a simple gel application, the technician insisted that coloured gel wouldn’t look good on my short nails, and in the end, my nails were actually cut even shorter during the process.

The results were far from what I expected. My nails look uneven, and the entire experience was frustrating and uncomfortable. I left feeling like I had wasted both my time and money.

To make matters worse, the next day, I noticed that my thumb nail wasn’t even coated with the last layer of gel. I returned to the salon to ask them to at least put on the top coat, but when they did, it ended up looking completely different in color because the worker allegedly forgot what shade she had used. It’s hard to believe that such an oversight could happen at a salon, especially with something as simple as a top coat.

I really wish the salon had been more transparent about the technician’s skill level beforehand. I won’t be returning or recommending this place to anyone. | review_rating:1, text:Went here for gel manicure . It cost me rm78. But the service is lousy. Such a lazy and rude staff.

It's colorful and pretty looking. That's what gets me all the time. What's more, it's Manuka Honey and not the pure sugar that is making it sweet. My choice of the Immune Booster was just nice with the sweetness level. Not that I'm hoping that my immune systems will get a boost from this, I'm not naive. But the drinks do suit my taste buds. | review_rating:5, text:As a fan of health-conscious beverages, I recently tried Manuka honey drink, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations in both taste and nutritional benefits.

Firstly, let's talk about the flavor. Manuka honey drink offers a delightful blend of sweetness from the honey with a subtle hint of earthiness. The richness of the honey provides a comforting warmth to each sip, making it a truly enjoyable experience.

Beyond its taste, the health benefits of Manuka honey are well-documented. Renowned for its antibacterial properties, Manuka honey is believed to support immune health and promote overall well-being. Knowing that each sip of this delicious beverage may contribute to my health gives me even more reason to indulge.

What I appreciate most about Manuka honey drink is its versatility. Whether enjoyed hot as a soothing beverage on a chilly day or chilled for a refreshing pick-me-up, it never fails to satisfy my cravings for something both healthy and delicious.

In conclusion, Manuka honey drink has earned its place as a staple in my beverage repertoire. Its delectable flavor and potential health benefits make it a standout choice for anyone looking to elevate their drinking experience. I highly recommend giving it a try – your taste buds and your body will thank you. | review_rating:5, text:Just nice packing and very gentle staff.

Only RM 2.99 per cup of coffee of your choice from their menu. They offer a wide variety of coffees which range from RM 10 _ RM 15. So cheap n highly affordable. So we also joined the queue. The workers worked very fast n were very efficient in preparing the coffee. We didn't need to wait long before we got our coffee. They were very orderly n systematic in their operation too. First we had to scan the QR code n then download the app n then register n then choose your coffee n then you make your payment.

A big shout out to stylist Vaan. He’s so meticulous and he managed to do all of the items within 2 hours as I have a flight to catch. Every step of the chemical treatment there’s scalp protector and additional ampoule to not be so painful for my scalp during the chemical processes and he kept checking on my hair and whether I can take the pain.

•	Family-Friendly Activities: The mall features an indoor ice-skating rink and a massive arcade that are perfect for kids and adults alike. My daughter loves to play at Parenthood. They have upgraded it too recently and we enjoyed it.
•	Food Haven: Offers an extensive selection of dining options from fast food to upscale restaurants. For Indian food you can try Mantra Restaurant (Not great but decent)
•	Convenient Layout: Despite its size, the mall is well-organized, making navigation easy.
•	Themed Decor: The Egyptian-inspired architecture adds a unique charm, making every visit memorable.

A big shout out to stylist Vaan. He’s so meticulous and he managed to do all of the items within 2 hours as I have a flight to catch. Every step of the chemical treatment there’s scalp protector and additional ampoule to not be so painful for my scalp during the chemical processes and he kept checking on my hair and whether I can take the pain.  He is also very good at picking colours- I only do cool tone colours and without me saying he already mixed the silver-gray as a colour to uniformly tone my colour.

So I bought a logitech mouse for 300+ which sells between 250-300 on lazada. You have to understand that all shops here especially the tech shops in Asian Avenue will sell items at higher prices. This is because rent for pyramid is high. Those who give ratings such as *overprice* without a good reason - no comments.

I did NOT buy a laptop so I am not aware of the quality of service this place offers and so you have to take ur own risk when buying from here.

Pros: You can exchange faulty peripherals with other peripherals from other brands within 14 days of purchase if u are a member. (Rm300 purchase gives u free membership).

You also get 1 year warranty.

Cons: Slightly more expensive.

My personal opinion: I try not to buy from lazada and stuff for electronic devices because they is no certification that it is original and it is very difficult to exchange or send ur device for warranty when u purchase it online.

The lack of communication, persistent stock shortages, and difficulty in reaching the service centre have caused significant inconvenience. Below is a timeline of the incident and my key concerns.

Timeline of the Incident:
16 February 2025 – I contacted the Sunway Pyramid service centre to schedule a screen replacement for my Samsung S23 Ultra. I was informed that the screen was out of stock but would be restocked on 18 February 2025. Following this, I requested to book an appointment for 22 February 2025, and the service centre advised me to send my details via WhatsApp. I did so, and they acknowledged my request with a ""noted"" response. Based on this, I assumed my appointment was confirmed.

22 February 2025 – I called the service centre to reschedule my appointment to 23 February 2025. It was only then that I was informed that the screen was still out of stock.

Complaint Points:
Poor Communication – If I had not called on 22 February, I would have traveled to the service centre on 23 February only to find out the screen was still unavailable. Why wasn’t I informed in advance that the stock had not arrived? As a service provider, the service centre should proactively notify customers if their scheduled repairs cannot proceed due to stock unavailability.

Frequent Stock Shortages – Why does the service centre frequently face stock shortages for essential replacement parts? Does this mean customers will always have to wait indefinitely to get their devices repaired? Being unable to use my phone for an extended period has caused unnecessary inconvenience, and potential financial losses.

Extremely Difficult to Contact – I found it extremely difficult to reach the service centre. As an authorized service provider for a global brand like Samsung, the service centre should have a more accessible and responsive customer support system.

The poor service I experienced has been frustrating and unacceptable. As a loyal Samsung customer, I expect better service quality and a more reliable repair process | review_rating:2, text:Left my fold 4 with the center on Saturday, received a call to collect in on Thursday. They claim to replace the screen but I can see that it is still the same screen (there is a slight mark on the screen. It is still there, meaning it's the same screen). They fix the issue with the phone turning off when using the inner screen. However, the center returned my phone with scratches and screen bubbling. They do not handle your phone with care. I suggest take lots of photo and video as evidence before you hand over to them. | review_rating:5, text:came in with a flip 3 samsung that half of the screen was damage, i want to tranfers my data from that phone but couldnt since the screen cant be use. the obvious solution was to replace the flip 3 screen that cost rm1k but i dont want to do that since it was an old phone and already have a new one. however, there was this nice uncle samsung worker who go out of his way to help me, even took out a usb mouse to help me tranfer the data. couldnt be more grateful for the uncle | review_rating:1, text:Brought my s20 to repair for cracked screen but after repair my screen have issues with tapping which it move around itself. Visiting 2nd time within a week and informed that my phone when sent it to them it is already have this issue which supposed I am sure supposed not to be. As luckily I have video record as proof my phone condition before left my phone to them.

The problem didn't been solved and I don't wish to send my phone there again. Now it become my backup phone and I bought another new phone because of their poor workmanship.

Please be reminded they may told you estimated 4 to 5 working days but you still need to chase them for a follow-up and at last can be taken even more than 1 week time to collect your item. Worst thing is your phone's problem didn't get solved after long waiting time.

I am a Samsung users for more than 10 years but tbh if your phone have problems, it is better you find phone repair specialist rather than their authorized service center. Why? because my new phone's screen cracked again and i decided to bring my to phone repair specialist.

However, when I re-checked the jacket a 2nd time, they have secretly removed the 30% discount label. The senior guy cashier called his boss and came up with a “solution” that they can use their staff rate discount to give us 50% discount provided we buy another item from the shop. We agreed to that.

I got a pain au chocolat and a caramel latte for 9.50 and 16.00 respectively, totalling to 27.05 after tax, which is a little steep of a pricing to be honest, but its just a little more expensive than usual cafe prices nowadays, so its still acceptable.

the pain au chocolat was average, nothing extraordinary, it had nice layers and a fair amount of chocolate inside, but for the price, I personally wouldn’t get it again, but it’s not bad.
the caramel latte was actually quite enjoyable, it fit my tastes well, it’s somewhat sweet with good caramel flavour, but not overwhelmingly sweet, and the coffee flavour was present but more mellow than others i’d say, which is still quite nice. and their ice is really crunchy👍🧊

service was standard too, order and pay at counter, get a beeper thing, take a seat and wait until it beeps to go get your order.

overall not bad, would be back again to try different things.

The boss told me it was the last piece and a display item. I initially hesitated to buy it, but the boss assured me it had only been put on display that morning and was in good condition. He even said, “It’s almost Chinese New Year, and you’re lucky to find one that fits you.”

However, when I prepared to wash it, I found a very noticeable defect on the sleeves, making the dress unwearable. This issue is unacceptable, especially since I trusted their assurance of the dress’s condition.

I have reached out to the shop to request an exchange or refund, but they have completely ignored me. This experience has been incredibly disappointing. Selling defective items while claiming they’re in perfect condition, especially for CNY, shows a lack of professionalism and care for customers.

DO NOT RECOMMEND TO BUY FROM THEM !!!! | review_rating:1, text:Wanted to try the outfit in blue but staff don’t allow. Only can try the size I want in pink. How do I know if I look good in blue or not if I’m not allowed to try ? First time encounter such clothing store that doesn’t allow customer to try on other colour.

However, we ended up waiting for a very long time (over 30 minutes). The ladies in front of us had already gone in, shopped, and left, yet we were still stuck outside like 🤡. The staff wouldn’t let us in, even though there were very few customers inside, while the queue outside kept growing.
What a terrible queue management. Also a lady casually walked in, supposedly to ask about her daughter’s clothes, but ended up browsing for herself ☺️, knowing that she’s cut the queue but still act dumb (or maybe she’s just dumb ☺️). The staff saw it happen and just acted like nothing was wrong 🤷🏻‍♀️. I would never enter this shop again 🙂 | review_rating:1, text:Although the clothes are nice, the staff's attitude is extremely negative. During Chinese New Year, they exhibit a type of expression that implies they have no money to buy their clothes like that. And I also saw a lot of negative reviews about the staff. If the shop's attitude remains unchanged, I will make a complaint to Sunway Pyramid Management. | review_rating:1, text:If I could give zero stars, I would. The service was absolutely terrible. The queue was incredibly long, and when we asked if we could go in—especially since most of the customers inside had already left—the staff told us to wait. To make matters worse, a customer blatantly cut the queue and went in, and the staff didn’t even bother to address it. This level of service is unacceptable",1,N/A,N/A

My haul was substantial due to the crazy good deals to be had🤭, and they were very accommodating, wrapping each piece of flatware, as well as allowed me to inspect the tea box before finalising my purchase.

I'd say Objet is the Malaysian equivalent to Kmart here in Sydney. Good value, not the highest quality items but still worth it - For example, the tea box I bought had a knob that I needed to buy the correct screw for, in order for it to sit securely on the lid and thus be functional.

•	Family-Friendly Activities: The mall features an indoor ice-skating rink and a massive arcade that are perfect for kids and adults alike. My daughter loves to play at Parenthood. They have upgraded it too recently and we enjoyed it.
•	Food Haven: Offers an extensive selection of dining options from fast food to upscale restaurants. For Indian food you can try Mantra Restaurant (Not great but decent)

He even said, “It’s almost Chinese New Year, and you’re lucky to find one that fits you.”

However, when I prepared to wash it, I found a very noticeable defect on the sleeves, making the dress unwearable. This issue is unacceptable, especially since I trusted their assurance of the dress’s condition.

I have reached out to the shop to request an exchange or refund, but they have completely ignored me. This experience has been incredibly disappointing. Selling defective items while claiming they’re in perfect condition, especially for CNY, shows a lack of professionalism and care for customers.

During a recent lunch treat by my boss, I opted for the Grilled Vege Ciabatta, a delightful combination of chargrilled vegetables nestled in a warm, crusty ciabatta. The flavors were well-balanced, and the fresh ingredients made for a hearty and satisfying bite. Accompanying my meal was the Lemongrass Mojito, an incredibly refreshing drink that was the perfect antidote to the sweltering afternoon heat. The vibrant mix of lemongrass and mint was both cooling and invigorating—highly recommended for those looking for a non-alcoholic thirst-quencher.

While my colleagues enjoyed their respective meals, I truly appreciated the effort put into crafting a flavorful and well-prepared plant-based option. Ole Ole Bali may not be a fully vegetarian restaurant, but it certainly caters to those seeking fresh, wholesome, and delicious plant-based alternatives.

Personally the dishes aren't quite my taste, everything seems a bit bland or not much flavor n  too oily for me either grilled or fried dish.

The same side dish is served at every rice set dish.

Chicken chop looks a bit over fried, it is a bit too dry.

Grill chicken is very oily.

Original serving of the pulut hita drink is too sweet... Should request for less sugar.

Somehow the food presentation is awesome.

Yet another Thai restaurant I visited in search of the perfect Mango sticky rice pudding. Before that we ordered the Pineapple rice served in a pineapple, Laksa, Chicken wings, a set meal and fried rice. The sticky rice was so sticky we needed a knife to cut it through, the coconut milk was too salty, the Laksa had an underwhelming flavour but the show stealers were the green chilli sauce that was the condiment on the table and minced chicken that came with the set meal. We were served a drink with the set meal that had an aftertaste of cough syrup. I still gave it 3 stars for food because the mango was nice and the fried rice and the pineapple rice were enjoyed by my friends. The chicken was described to be juicy and tender. | review_rating:4, text:I ordered the Thai Laksa coz I was curious as to how it tastes like. It tasted amazing! It is like an enhanced version of the northern asam laksa. Really tasty.

However, the portion that came was really, really small. I spoke to the waitress about it, saying that it’s really small for the price charged. Without question asked, she came back with more noodles for me. Great service!

The store do look like they needed more assistance tho, but despite that she’s the only one is store at that moment, she was rlly patience with every customer with their questions and also providing services to them. She was assuring me that she’ll come to me too to get my piercing done cuz the store that time was packed with customers. Overall a great experience, would definitely recommend anyone that’s looking to get their piercings done here. | review_rating:5, text:I did my first set of lobe piercings here! I entered the store to browse, but one of the staff there, Ross, started a conversation with me and that's when I asked about their piercing services.
I was planning to get needle piercing elsewhere at first but because Ross was helpful and knowledgeable, I ended up coming back here for their hand-pressure piercing.
Was pierced by Ross, who made me feel comfortable throughout - the whole thing was super quick and painless! It's been a week now and following the aftercare advice my ears are healing nicely with no swelling and minimal pain.
I've been to other Lovisa branches and honestly I am usually skeptical of the staff's skills but this Sunway Pyramid branch proved me wrong, they are professional, friendly and helpful.
I'll be back here for some surgical steel or titanium earrings once my healing period is up 🙌🏼 | review_rating:5, text:Went for piercing today, the Malay lady was super attentive and thank you for piercing very professionally!

Straight to the point we ordered their famous wanton noodles and butter buns and they were out of this world.

Their other food items like we ordered such as Luncheon meat noodles and rice , and yam bun were okay at best but still acceptable as they tasted very fresh and weren't too salty which means the limited usage of MSG which is a positive in my books 👍🏻

However, the reason why I'm rating it a 4 star is the delay of the food arrival as I understand there are a lot of customers but the kitchen staff should combat this and push dishes out quicker.

Environment wise, the cafe is very clean and has a vibrant decor which makes it welcoming for potential customers. There is an open window area on the side for people to look outside and embrace the nature where you can even see Sunway University in the distance.

This place looks great and the food tastes great. The staff are very attentive to your order and will even clear your plates when you’re done. The noodles’ texture is sparingly and slightly chewy.

The skin on my face is more sensitive and prone to spots than ever. I have started to get breakouts on my chin which I have never done before! My pores are more open I feel which is where the breakouts come from. the forehead also have stubborn breakouts that won’t go even with 2 months on highly rated dermalogica products such as the “age bright serum” which was super expensive yet has done little for my breakouts. Before this acne treatment, my “acne” was hardly noticeable and persistent but after this treatment it is due to my skin being more sensitive. I am extremely disappointed and frustrated. As I am from abroad and was only staying at Malaysia for short-term, I am not able to make a complaint in person or fight to get compensation - so I leave this review to warn other customers. If your skin breakouts aren’t severe and inflammatory, just go for natural treatments.

When I refused to pay a second time, the situation escalated quickly.

Their behavior was completely unprofessional and showed a total lack of respect for customers.

1) Overall - Fast food chain selling various of food such as root beer, waffle, fried chicken, coney, float and more, almost self service, spacious seating with washing basin provided by
A&W at Sunway Pyramid
2) coney - juicy coney with generous of minced beef gravy, highly recommended
3) mozza burger - tender and juicy beef patty, flavorful, fluffy bun, must try
4) curly fries - never disappoint
5) waffle - tasted good, fluffy and fragrant | review_rating:1, text:Gee thanks a&w for serving my rootbeer in a broken mug while not providing any straws anymore, very progressive of you. Like bro what if people are physically challenged and need a straw genius at least have some in stock. And broken mugs cannot throw? Clearly not the first knock this mug experienced and yall still continue serving this. Whats worse is i got served brown straight cut fries when my order says curly fries. I get it yall think your customers can’t tell shapes apart lmao | review_rating:1, text:I had a disappointing experience at this A&W outlet, primarily due to the poor food quality which was notably inconsistent. The waffles were unappealing, appearing artificial and were served cold and overly crispy. The ice cream was haphazardly presented in fragments rather than in a complete, rounded scoop. Additionally, the curly fries were served cold, suggesting they had been sitting out for hours. The root beer float lacked fizziness and was served without a straw, which was inconvenient. Furthermore, the spoon provided for the float was incorrect; it wasn’t the long spoon typically used for such drinks. This experience was starkly inferior compared to what I’ve previously enjoyed at other A&W locations abroad. Very disappointing overall. | review_rating:4, text:Nice roots beer n orange juice , but the need to beware of the floor skirting near the front counter, see lots of ppl nearly fall due to uneven floor skirting | review_rating:5, text:1.

After 9 days of using it (Yes, just 9 days!) the paint on the logo came off. We went in and request for an exchange or refund or ANY sort of solution with the original receipt and tag because it was clearly faulty. The lady that was “in-charged” says they can’t do anything. It is clearly faulty that I think even a fake one from online won’t do that within a month, let alone only 9 days of using it. They provide no solution at all and just ask us to contact Lacoste ourselves by giving us the generic website. It wasn’t even an discounted item and we paid FULL PRICE for such absurd product and service. The quality of the product is already disappointing enough, but with the attitude of that staff showing no sympathy (yup, not even an apology and all she say was “cannot refund” without any explanation) was just enough to show how Lacoste as a brand and their staffs value their customers.

The way they cook it is fantastic, and it keeps me coming back. Unfortunately, on my recent visit, the pork intestine was unavailable, which was disappointing. I enjoy both the baby spicy and original flavors, but I prefer the original with extra garlic. However, this time, the garlic tasted off—almost spoiled, which was a letdown.

The soup has been consistently good since my first visit, and it didn’t disappoint this time either. I also tried the cheese mantou today. While the exterior was crispy and nice, the cheese filling had a strange low-quality plastic container smell, and when eaten together, it tasted slightly sour. It wasn’t a pleasant experience.

Unfortunately, the dry hotpot here isn’t great at all👎👎. It’s too bland, just plain spicy and lack of good flavor (i don’t know why they wana add cumin flavor into it cos it’s actually meant for chinese bbq but they added this into dry hotpot which made it really weird). Nevertheless, the mala soup actually tastes really good 👍(but you get the same flavour from Master Kang instant noodles🤣) .

Another thing that put me off  is the so-called member price. It’s free to join then you get discount, but why bother to require that when you already allow everyone join for free. Wasting time and just finding excuse to charge more. Price actually is quite reasonable though. But overall i won’t go back to this brand outlets again. 😅

Finally reminder, when you select the pork or beef, it is usually rolled up so it’s easy to clip, MAKE SURE you tell the counter that you don’t want it to be cut into smaller pieces, my pork belly roll mysteriously ended up as 2 small pieces only 😹.

•	Food Haven: Offers an extensive selection of dining options from fast food to upscale restaurants. For Indian food you can try Mantra Restaurant (Not great but decent)
•	Convenient Layout: Despite its size, the mall is well-organized, making navigation easy.
•	Themed Decor: The Egyptian-inspired architecture adds a unique charm, making every visit memorable.

Finding vegetarian dining options beyond the typical Chinese restaurants can be challenging, so I was pleased to come across this establishment.

For my meal, I ordered an egg roll dish, okra skewer, and kimchi soup ramen. While the okra skewer may not have had the most visually appealing presentation when it arrived at the table, I was pleased to find that the okra was not overcooked. Instead, it maintained a satisfying crunchiness, which is how I prefer my okra to be prepared.

The kimchi ramen was decent overall, though I didn't particularly enjoy some of the ingredients, such as the bean sprouts and cabbage. Personal preferences aside, I appreciated the opportunity to find a suitable vegetarian restaurant option within the Sunway Pyramid mall.

Overall, I'm glad I was able to discover this Japanese vegetarian restaurant, as it provided a refreshing change of pace from the more common Chinese vegetarian offerings in the area.

I went here because I've been to APT Salon several times when I lived in Penang and the service and quality there was good. And even prices were very reasonable.
Over here, in Sunway Pyramid, they charged me 60+ RM for my thin hair. I was still okay to pay because I wanted good service.
The person who washed my hair couldn't understand a word of English. He took me directly to the hair wash basin for the wash, unlike how it used to be done at the Penang branch. Before starting I asked him to shampoo only once as my hair tends to get too dry with double shampooing. But he went ahead and shampooed twice anyway.
Then when he was applying conditioner I requested that he leave it on for a couple of minutes so it can actually condition my hair and he said ok, but washed it off in less than 15 seconds. 🤷‍♀️
Then, while blowdrying he used the high heat blast from the very beginning and kept bringing it very close to my scalp. And he kept focussing on the back of my scalp while the front was just airdrying and setting to become kind-of messy-frizzy..
After he was done I had to ask him to apply hair serum, and That's something that he should have done without me asking considering how sadly he had blow-dried my hair.
After the wash my scalp has been completely damaged. It's been almost 3 weeks now since this hair wash and my scalp has not recovered yet. The back portion of my scalp is still soar and extremely itchy and i usually never have an itchy scalp. I've never faced this issue ever before. I'm not sure if it's bad products used or bad technique or both together, but it's ruined my scalp. All I wanted was a relaxing hair wash. But instead left disappointed with a damaged scalp.
One thing salon Staff should understand is that everyone coming there has different hair types and should be handled according to that. ONE METHOD/FORMULA DOESN'T FIT ALL when it comes to hair. Especially in Malaysia where you find a mix of people from so many ethnicities it's expected all the more.
Anyway all in all, bad service and disappointing experience.

Today, I finally gave it a shot and ordered an Avocado drink since it was on sale for just RM8. While it was tasty and decent for the price, I don’t think it quite met the standard of a full-priced RM12.90 drink.

What really let me down, however, was the cashier’s attitude during my visit. As a first-timer at Juicy, I was hoping for a little guidance, but the female staff didn’t bother explaining the avocado drink options on the menu. Instead, she abruptly asked, “Avocado apa?” without pointing out the choices from the start. After I paid, she handed me the receipt without a word of thanks. Even though I said “thank you” to her, she didn’t smile or acknowledge it—her expression clearly showed she didn’t want to be there.

The lack of professionalism became even more apparent when the next customer (as seen in the photo) pointed out a mistake in their order. Rather than apologising and fixing the drink, the staff exchanged annoyed glances with each other.

Yes I know you need to serve your walk ins, but please be mindful to scan it la after serving them, so hard to scan ke?

Not demure at all. Not responsible at all.

Don't forget we platform sellers, are your customers too.

Your reply already shows that you don't even bother about it. Thanks for proving my point. Again , I dont expect the parcels to scan IMMEDIATELY.

The food tastes good but leans towards a heavier and oilier base. If you can't handle spicy food, I’d recommend avoiding the dishes I ordered.

Portion-wise, the servings are generous, but the pricing is on the higher side. For example, the medium-sized Spicy Sour Soup Dory Fish costs RM108, but it's enough to be shared among four ladies. The 双椒辣子鸡 costs RM49, which I find a bit overpriced because the chicken cubes are really small and mixed with other ingredients. Based on the taste, I believe they’ve added fried potato cubes, so most of the dish consists of vegetables—mainly two types of chili and potato cubes. The potato is fine to eat, but the chili depends on your spice tolerance.

Service-wise, I was impressed. They have a unique way of calling for staff using a peace ✌🏻 hand sign, which I found interesting (but personally for me as an introverted person, I was really shy to do it). The service team was attentive and had a good attitude.

I might return, but I’d definitely bring at least two more friends to share the portions—if you're a small eater, you won’t be able to finish everything on your own! | review_rating:5, text:Today finally managed to get a chance to dine here after 2 times failed to get in for the past 1 year.

Fish used was normal though and a tad bit oily.

The chicken in spicy 🌶 oil is worth trying whereas the prawns with fen si is savory but a bit oily as well. The veggies was normal but the fried chicken with sweet & sour sauce was worth the try.

Prepare to wait on hols or weekends but they do have a queue system which is good and the service staff will give u a call when it's your turn. | review_rating:5, text:Some may say it is cheap fish but I think it tasted delicious.

•	Food Haven: Offers an extensive selection of dining options from fast food to upscale restaurants. For Indian food you can try Mantra Restaurant (Not great but decent)
•	Convenient Layout: Despite its size, the mall is well-organized, making navigation easy.

I was told by the receptionist lady that there was no masseuse available, so I thought a masseur would do because I had requested a 1 hour head, shoulder, and back massage. I told the lady to tell him to avoid from the sensitive areas like the chest and underarms.
We agreed & proceed with the payment.

However, there are a few things that have severely disappointed me:

1. The masseur asked me to lie face down and begin with leg massage. I was confused and asked him, but his response was brief: ""wait"" till he focused on so much of my hip, at which point I asked if he could start with head and shoulder massage?

2. When we continue with the head and shoulder massage, he tends to “massage” my chest, which makes me feel so uncomfortable that I have to stop him right away.

3. He assumed the massage was 30mins instead of 60 mins until I ask him to double check with the receptionist again.

4. I think they need proper training / professional training, comparable what he has done on the right side, but it was different on the left. Either too much emphasis on the right or only for a short time on the left.

5. Overall experience was really bad due to poor communication. Even if you ask a basic question, either no response or unable to communicate.

It’s just the skirt is dirty, which I would want another one. Then they just ask me so rudely whether I want to buy or not.

Maybe it's because we dressed casually, but when we entered, I tried some perfume samples and decided to buy a new one, as I had used it before. Unfortunately, an auntie SA suddenly approached us, briefly promoted the product, and then just left us there. My mom noticed that her expression seemed to suggest she thought we couldn't afford the price, and as a result, she didn't want to serve us . Immediately, my mom took me to another brand, where the SA was much more professional. Please make sure to properly train your sales associates.

When I walked in and asked for input on specific product, I needed some opinions on what to get, an older staff simply pointed me to a section without offering any real help and quickly moved on to attend to someone else while also showing a strong attitude.

Only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because there's a chinese guy that is much friendlier and attentive compared to the rest.

I'm writing now because another person said something about an old woman who works there. So here's what happened. This old lady that worked there was extremely rude and basically said that there's no shade for my skin tone in their shop in a condescending manner when I entered the store. Mind you, I'm Indian. She was constantly making comments on my skin texture by comparing it to my sister's. It made me feel very insecure.  She was also hesitant to help out. No smile or polite gestures. I left without buying anything because I was so upset. A couple of weeks later I passed by dior again. The same woman was very smiley and inviting to a few Chinese girls who were walking across to enter the branch. Feels very racist. The management should do something about this.

It's highly unprofessional for someone to treat a customer in such a manner.

The staff came back later and say because its frozen squid ring, after cooked, the skin becomes like this cause of the bubbles. Really? Like really im supposed to believe that? Or is it a fly laid eggs on it thats why it has those white things? Don’t say they are sesame seed also because they are smaller than that. I’ve asked a chef that has been dealing with frozen squid rings for years, he mentioned he never seen such thing before.

I ordered the Jumbo Tenderloin Katsu set to share with my parents. The pork was tender and nicely bartered and fried. It tasted better with the sauce, as it is a little dry.

Ordered a Claypot Thai Milk Coffee.

Was so looking forward to an ""immersive tasting experience"". Unfortunately, none at all! Neither was there any touted ""exotic aroma"" nor ""intricate flavours"". Coffee was mediocre -- lacked strength and richness. Disappointed!

Also ordered Pak Lung's Roti Bakar. Pandan was good - smooth, rich, creamy and fragrant. But roti bakar was squashed as if someone had squeezed it and wasn't well toasted.

Nevertheless, splendid location with good vantage point to watch the world go by. Good pitstop to take a break from shopping. | review_rating:4, text:The aroma is very nice when you are near the shop.
I like their menu choices, habe tried the thai milk tea and butterfly pea milk. Both refreshing and smells very nice.
Only downside is that its way too sweet for me. | review_rating:5, text:Opening Promotion till 11/11/24, buy 2 free 1.

Excellent coffee with a unique flavor where it is fused with Pandan leaves.

Do remember to ask for your preferred level of sweetness.

The atmosphere is great and comfy.. eventhough there is only 7 table at this shop.. to stop and take a stop is great here.. have your coffee or teatime here..

Currently the menu that i LOVE is Claypot Thai Tea Milk, Claypot Thai Tea Coffee, Claypot Thai Cocoa, Claypot Thai Horkasai, Thai Lemon Tea and Last But Not Least Thai Claypot Thai Green Milk Tea.. The Price is reasonable to upgrade only Add On RM1.. The packaging itself is nice and engaging..

Staff is friendly and great.. very helpful and help customer to guide what is their signature drink.. overall happy with this drink..

I went to the G floor branch (next to Parkson).

The first time I went to counter 1 to change A currency, I said I wanted to split two receipts, he said he couldn’t split the transaction and asked me to queue up again.

OK, Second time I went to counter 1 again (only 1 counter is open) and changed A currency.

Seeing that there was no one in line behind me, I said I wanted to change B currency, he said no, he could only change money from one country per person at a time, which means I had to wait until someone came to queue up to change money before I could change money for the third time?

Meanwhile counter 2 is open, then I pointed to counter 2 and asked if I could change money, counter 1 said NO, because counter 2 is new and he didn’t know how to do it.

This is the biggest and the most comprehensive outlet of Adidas. Best Adidas outlet in Malaysia without a doubt. The staffs are all pro-active and very knowledgeable about its products. It has 2 floors. Adidas Performance at the lower floor and Adidas Originals on the upper floor. Widest selection is available here and you get the latest products and customization here too 👍 highly recommended. Well done! | review_rating:1, text:I was at your adidas branch on the 26th of January on Sunday. Went there to purchase & customize a Jersey. STAFF no. 1 served me and went to confirm with the customization team which letters and numbers were available in stock. After confirming, STAFF no. 1 said that ONLY THE LETTER A was not in stock so he recommended me to purchase the letter at the Liverpool store opposite of adidas ( apparently he said that adidas customers do that when adidas runs out of letters or numbers ) So I went and purchase the letter A at the Liverpool store and went back to adidas to finally purchase the jersey. When I came back to the store I was served by STAFF NO. 2. STAFF NO. 2 brought me to the customization area to confirm the customization after I had told them the story of me purchasing the letter A. When I was at the customization counter suddenly the customization staff now said NUMBER 1 is also out of stock? To add another plot twist to the story after going back and forth with the staffs there, the same customization staff that initially SAID THE LETTER A and NUMBER 1 was unavailable suddenly said THE LETTER S is also out of stock when I showed him the player’s name and number for the second time? And what would have happened and how would it have been resolved if I went to the Liverpool store again and purchased the number 1 only for the hopeless customization staff to say that now the letter S is also out of stock? :D
( Do note that In the midst of encountering all these 3 incompetent staff and me going back and forth purchasing the unavailable letter at a different store I already showed them the Name and Number I wanted to put on the Jersey ) I don’t usually get triggered or mad at things like this as I am also working as a retail staff and I know how fussy certain customers can get sometimes but honestly it was your staffs fault for handing out wrong information over and over again. Wouldn’t it just be settled if any of the 3 staff actually would have just told me which letter and number was unavailable in the first place? Hence, today was probably the dumbest customer service I’ve encountered in my years of being a customer.

On a happy note, another Female customization staff was working on that day but she was at the upper floor as she was in charge of the redemption counter on that day ( based on the information given to me ) she was the one who apologized and insisted on reimbursing me for the initial letter A that I purchased. Kudos to her for helping out in settling the matter as the other Male customization staff kept laughing and saying that “I don’t know” a million times throughout the whole issue. Felt bad that she was the one who had to take out money from her own pocket when it was the initial 3 useless staff that caused the whole problem with their wrong information to begin with.

According to the female staff, she said that the customization team and the retail team aren’t linked together. So my opinion / suggestion is for both side to get correct information beforehand so something stupid like this does not happen again because it’s quite troublesome for your customers when each staff is giving out a different story every time. | review_rating:1, text:Had a sales guy ( Ashraf?

They were having a 20% discount offer for their hot food offerings when I visited.

I ordered the chicken pie that came with a side of brown gravy and mashed potato. The pie crust was okay although I wished it was a little lighter and fluffier. It was also not as warm as I would have preferred it. Nonetheless, the filling was flavorful with a mix of chicken and mushroom. For the price however, they could have given more pieces of chicken.

Service was relatively fast although there were only 2 occupied tables. Seating was comfortable and the decor had a nicer minimalist look that I appreciate. | review_rating:4, text:I popped into Pineyard at Sunway Pyramid with my mum recently, hoping to find a cosy spot for brunch. We decided on the grilled sourdough sandwich first; it was nicely buttered and crisp on the outside but turned out rather hard and chewy. The filling of mushrooms, spinach, and cheese had a lovely flavour, albeit a bit on the oily side.

The carbonara was rich, creamy, and made even more indulgent by a runny poached egg. The deep-fried chicken ham added a satisfying crunch and extra savouriness. We also had an iced gula melaka and an orange juice—both decent choices.

Price-wise, Pineyard leans slightly towards the higher end, but I must say the service was prompt and friendly. | review_rating:5, text:I had their carbonara for dinner and it was so good, I really love it. I also bought their pasties and they're really soft even if you eat it the next day.

The price for the dish and pastries are slightly expensive but I'd say it matched with the quality of the food.

I purchased a phone case from this shop because my old one was broken. I asked the guy (circled in red) if they had a phone case for the Honor 50. He mentioned that since the Honor 50 is an older model, it was lucky they had one last piece in stock. Trusting his word, I decided to purchase it without asking the price, there was no price tag label on the phone case packaging.

At the counter, he started cleaning my phone screen without asking me first. After that, he charged me RM69 for the phone case—much more than I expected! When I politely asked if there was any discount, he only reduced the price by RM2, bringing it to RM67. I reluctantly paid and left the shop, but after discussing it with my friend, my friend and I felt that the guy ""scammed"" me since similar phone cases are sold on Shopee for RM10-30.

Within an hour, I returned to the shop with the receipt to request a refund. However, the guy refused, saying that once the package is opened, they cannot resell it. I considered reporting this to MDTCA, but the process would take too long. I strongly advise anyone to not visiting this shop. | review_rating:5, text:Good service!

For my right-hand pain, I received cupping and acupuncture. The cups were too large, kept falling off (she knows it), however she left me unattended. During acupuncture, I felt nothing, and she used fewer than 5 needles, which made me question whether she was addressing the issue effectively.

The villa itself was spacious, beautifully designed, and incredibly comfortable—perfect for a relaxing retreat. A special shoutout to Shahmin and his team for their outstanding hospitality; they were friendly, helpful, and truly enhanced our stay.

I genuinely cannot understand why this place gets 5-star ratings. The ride attendants are rude and unhelpful, and customer service is clueless—even the so-called “customer specialists” don’t know how to handle guests. The park itself is old, decaying, and poorly maintained. The shacks and huts are a complete waste of time, and the wave pool only operates for 45 minutes at the very end of the day. The whole place smells bad and feels like it’s falling apart.

For a family of five, we spent $700 AUD—absolutely not worth it. There are so many better places in Malaysia to visit for a fraction of the cost. Even with a quick pass, there was no need to wait for rides, which only made the purchase feel like a scam. The photos online are misleading, so don’t fall for the marketing.

This was our experience in January/February 2025.

Before we ordered, we did ask the waiter can we share one main course by adding another side dish? If not we just add in the bottomless refill package. (Here i need to mention that I’ve dine in at another branch - Mid Valley so i knew it was workable. And the reason for us to share is we really can’t finish all if we order two main course)

The waiter said OK without explaining anything. But when we ask for refill he take the menu to us said that if u want to refill you need to add the bottomless refill, but we did ask at the very beginning. He said OK! And the way he explain to us is really make us uncomfortable is like we asking for food. But hello? It’s just cabbage? How much it cost? And fine, i know you have your own rules, but why you didn’t mention it clearly at first?

And after that we said nvm, we continue having the rest of our food. After that he suddenly come over and refilled the cabbage for us, without saying anything. This really makes us feel uncomfortably and disrespectful.

I recently visited a Dunkin' Donuts outlet and was left feeling frustrated and disappointed by the customer service.

When I was deciding on my order, the staff member insisted that I purchase four donuts to receive a box. While I understand the desire to minimize waste, it felt inflexible and inconvenient, especially for a smaller order.

Moreover, the lack of a larger bag to carry the individual paper bags was surprising. It seemed like a minor detail, but it added to the overall inconvenience of the experience.

While Dunkin' Donuts has historically offered boxes for smaller orders, this recent experience suggests a potential downgrade in customer service. It's important to remember that good customer service can significantly impact a customer's overall satisfaction.

I hope that Dunkin' Donuts will take steps to improve their customer service policies and training to ensure a more positive experience for future customers. | review_rating:3, text:Sweet treat is not for me, but I do drop here to pack these colourful, vibrant, attractive and hunger calling donuts.

First, they doesn't seems very familiar with the name of the drink on the reserved menu. They need to double check on the menu to confirm what's really customer mentioned when place order.

Secondly, the ticket doesn't place / stick well to the drinks producing counter. It caused that no barista noticed that there are a pending order to make (reserve coffee menu). After all, they keep calling customer name while food ready but nobody making the drink.

At the end,  the drink has served finally, but as photo shown, been ordered a Reserve menu coffee, but served without the Starbucks Reserve black sleeve and the complimentary chocolate. Definitely not well trained enough.

Then I saw a barista served the food over to a female customer to her table but forgot the drink itself. The female customer has to get up and go over the waiting section to get the drink by herself after all.

- Menu changed from beef, pork, chicken TO lamb, pork, chicken.
- if you want beef, need to choose beef, pork, lamb and chicken. (More expensive)
Price increased, which is not the main issue.

THE PROBLEM IS:

Meat quality dropped!
(My partner and I hoped that this day would never come)
First time we came here was in 2023, we thought the quality of meat here was amazing especially for the price range. The pork belly/shoulder and beef karubi used to be so tender, but I can no longer say it is the same.
We are regular customers and we recommended this restaurant to many of our friends and family (because of the beautiful meat quality), but now we have to think twice if we’d want to eat here again.
- When sat down at our table, we found out that even EGGS are no longer part of the buffet. They need to be added on for RM1/egg. So extremely disappointing!!!
- sauces here isn’t very good but the meat dipped in eggs always made it better, again, utterly disappointed with Shabu-yo charging for eggs (?!?!?!)

- kitchen staff is so noisy. Dropping bowls and plates and cheering every time someone drops another bowl/plate. Kinda annoying to be hearing this when seated near the kitchen.

Honestly, all this complaints could be tolerated but then the meat quality dropped, that’s not ok with me. | review_rating:5, text:I love this place.

All the staff have to go through deep and serious training. Even the foods was so so only, everywhere is very messy tot think that it's not that busy. And even though on busy times should not let your buffet bar messy, dirty tissues everywhere, veggies all over the place. Staffs no basic manners, clear table just take plates, serve the food just bang on your table without saying anything. All are black face and not talking, robot is better at least they greet but these people nothing. But when they are chatting while clearing tables their voices are so loud and happy back to customer gave you poker unhappy face. Most of the waitresses hair are so messy too not appropriate in F&B standard. Kitchen door widely open can see how messy and dirty inside, staff room door open too showing us all shoes while eating is it? The another long hair waitress arranging all the pots banging so loud makes the diners disturb if not happy why not go back home. Ice cream melted, waffle bitter and put there no cover at all. Your golden soup is the worse I've ever tasted too no taste at all, other beef cutting is wrong side making it so tough. Most of the sauces are all chili taste without any saltiness or sweetness I know we can add on seasoning but do we need to adjust everything on our own meh?

Marinated BBQ meats were moist, tender and tasty. Seafood and vegetables could have better been served with some oil/marinade on the side to prevent it from being too dry during BBQ.

The waiter was very professional and trying to make me feel comfortable. He was patiently explain to me about the menu. I also overheard him explain to an old couple behind me for quite a long time without getting annoyed. Big respect for the waiter patience.

The location of the hotel is fine. The deluxe room comes with the basic amenities and the space is manageable. Our room was a bit old but it was clean. The body wash in the bathroom had a very foul smell, so probably it has expired. It would be better if the cleaning staff could pay more attention to this.

🏨 Hotel (3/5)
•	Crowded lobby, long queues for check-in.
•	Late check-in issue – even at 3 PM, the room wasn’t ready.
•	Extra bed charge is RM 189, quite expensive.
•	Parking costs RM 15 even after validation.

📍 Location (5/5)
•	Perfect location – directly connected to Sunway Pyramid Mall.
•	Easy access to restaurants and shops without leaving the hotel.

🛏️ Room (3/5)
•	Smelly sofa, affecting comfort.
•	Slow WiFi connection.

•	No kids channel on the TV, limited entertainment options.

🍽️ Breakfast (3/5)
•	Expensive – RM 65 for kids, around RM 90 for adults.
•	Very crowded, sharing the same breakfast area with Sunway Resort Hotel.
•	Quite a walk to the dining area – not convenient for families with small children.

💰 Overall (3/5) - Not Worth the Price

For a 4-star hotel, the price feels too high compared to the overall experience. The location is the only highlight, but service, facilities, and comfort need improvement. | review_rating:4, text:Cleanliness could be better. The room offers privacy and a good view.

The adjustment was done on the day and I’ve tried it as well.

They say engraving have to wait till the next day 12pm only can be done, on Sunday I called them they said the ring can be done before 2pm. Unfortunately at 1pm when I’m on my way to Sunway Pyramid I received a call from them, said that the engraving can only be done after 4pm. So I’m not able to collect it on Sunday because I don’t want to waste my time waiting there.

Today 1 October Tuesday, I went to collect my ring but the condition is bad, the surface of the ring is scratched. What I’m angry the most is the staff no inform me at the phone about this until I go and collect it they also didn’t mention about anything to me until I saw the scratches on the ring. I asked them why is it like this. Their answer is this can only be fixed at Hong Kong in 2-3 months time. I send a good condition ring over but received a scratched ring? The staff didn’t mention anything about before I ask. The staff should have realise this issue before hand and inform customer and give customer solution to solve this. When the staff handover to me, she just said, the ring is done adjustment and engraving please check, they didn’t even admit they are sorry for scratched the ring and how they can solve it until I ask them. And the scratches are on top of the ring I don’t believe no one else has seen it.

This kind of customer service attitude are bad because it’s not about how far I came to collect it or am I urgently need to use the ring. We bought the marriage ring to wear it not just to use it. It Is the customer expectation to collect a beautiful fit ring from the shop.

Furthermore there is a bus area whereby there is some kitchen toys and soft blocks available for play but the condition is very bad, the soft blocks has been chew off and there isn’t much kitchen utensils to play with, only an empty kitchen counter there. Worst still there are many uncovered electric plug points there whereby toddlers will be able to touch it freely, the electric plug point shouldn’t be built there or at least it must be covered up with child protection measures. My young daughter went to play with the switch and i have to constantly tell her not to touch it! This is unacceptable as this is a children playground.

The venue itself is perfect for kids with a variety of activities that kept everyone entertained. The indoor play areas are spacious, well-maintained, and suitable for children of all ages. My son and his friends had a blast exploring all the fun attractions. It was also a great place for adults to relax and catch up, while keeping an eye on the little ones.

The staff at The Parenthood were super friendly and helpful, making sure everything ran smoothly. They took care of all our needs, from setup to ensuring the kids were safe and having fun.

The birthday party packages were fantastic too, offering a wide selection of entertainment options, delicious food, and even personalized touches to make the day special. We couldn’t have asked for a better place to celebrate this milestone.

Entry was swift. Staff are helpful and accommodating. Siligent on cleaning even on a non busy day. It has different play sections, which is good, so older kids will not hurt by accident the younger ones. There are lots of slides, which is fun even for small built adults.

The entrance fee is very reasonable for a whole day play.  About 30 ringgit on weekday / 60 ringgit on weekend, public and school holiday.
Re entry is allowed as long as within that day and with a guardian or parent going in together. Extra guardian or parent is charged 5 ringgit.

Socks is needed to enter like most playgrounds. They charge a reasonable 7 ringgit in case you need it.

There's also a cafe inside where parents could rest while waiting. Opposite the playground is a  shop for kids stuff.

Overall, it's worth it to try. | review_rating:3, text:A beautifully designed play area for children, with the London bus outside being the most attractive feature! It’s a fun place for kids to explore and enjoy.

However, I felt a little disappointed as the playground space is smaller than last year, and the horse carousel ride is no longer there. The area feels shorter than before, which affects the overall play experience.

One major concern is safety—the staff should keep an eye on kids playing rough, especially on the big slide. Since children of all ages play together, some older kids don’t follow the play rules, making it scary for kids under 7 to enjoy themselves.

Hope the management can improve the playground space and safety monitoring in the future!",4.2,+60 16-210 4398,"Monday: 10:00 AM – 9:30 PM, Tuesday: 10:00 AM – 9:30 PM, Wednesday: 10:00 AM – 9:30 PM, Thursday: 10:00 AM – 9:30 PM, Friday: 10:00 AM – 9:30 PM, Saturday: 10:00 AM – 9:30 PM, Sunday: 10:00 AM – 9:30 PM"

We ordered the healthy drink Power size with #myDigi app promotion. The staff poured the drink to the Power size cup and it wasn't full so she added a cup of ice and blended again to pour it into the cup to make it full. We drank it and it was too bland and tasteless. We nicely feedback to the staffs and the replies we got was it's bland because it's health drink without yogurt in it and both the staffs keep insisting that's the reason the juice got bland. We then told them that they have added so much ice into it and they kept insisting they only add in half cup of ice which we saw there are a total of 2 full cup of ice (before blended the first round and 2nd round another cup). They didn't want to take responsibility for it and just simply give reasons to shoo us away instead of helping the paying customers. We then went to the cashier to tell the cashier thinking she might be the person who could at least solve the problem but she just acted blur and turned away. The staffs also asked us to move away and not blocking the cashier for other customers to make payment which then there were no customers behind us. This is SUPER RUDE. One of the staff then get our drink and then asked to pour away the ice but it was blended and we wonder how she would do that to pour away the ice? We saw her just pour the drink out to the blender and pour some juice away into the sink then pour back into the cup. And guess what the content becomes even lesser and the TASTE IS STILL BLAND. The staffs are trying to CHEAT on customers CONSTANTLY. We were so tired of their NONSENSE. At last the staff took the drink back and pour back into the blender and add one tiny piece of pineapple to add abit of taste to blend. It had a bit of taste but still the TASTE IS OFF.

•	Diverse Shopping: With a wide array of shops, it caters to all family members, from fashion to gadgets.
•	Family-Friendly Activities: The mall features an indoor ice-skating rink and a massive arcade that are perfect for kids and adults alike. My daughter loves to play at Parenthood. They have upgraded it too recently and we enjoyed it.
•	Food Haven: Offers an extensive selection of dining options from fast food to upscale restaurants. For Indian food you can try Mantra Restaurant (Not great but decent)
•	Convenient Layout: Despite its size, the mall is well-organized, making navigation easy.
•	Themed Decor: The Egyptian-inspired architecture adds a unique charm, making every visit memorable.

Ordered chicken kebab today (though I almost got hurt biting into a bone chip). Saw another review here that they also found bone chips in their kebabs. Something that I've not encountered in their other outlets. Perhaps a quality control issue.

The newly renovated stuff'd now uses machine ordering. The machine lagged when I was making payment, and staff were too busy to entertain my problems because Grab riders were more of a priority. After awhile, one of them rerouted the payment to the normal counter cashier (what was the point of the machine, then?)

Waiting time: Almost 20 minutes for a kebab. Not really acceptable considering most customers are here during their short lunch break. Like I've mentioned up there, they prioritize Grabfood more than walk-in orders.

The space is too tiny for the amount of customers that drop by. Best to takeaway.
Probably won't be back in a long time until they've fixed their machines and service. | review_rating:3, text:Update**
Bought kebab today and it's absolutely soaked. Dripping everywhere as soon as I start eating and towards the end it was hard to even take a bite with all the water. Maybe teach your staff to properly drain the vege so we don't end up with damp kebab.

Frequent this place, always order chicken, today first time order beef and regretted. There were 3 bone chips in my beef kebab, could easily had chip my tooth. | review_rating:3, text:so is it burrito or kebab?

if the former, then it simply isn't as good as the competition round the corner.  which is the general dilemma of ""premium"" fast food. | review_rating:5, text:As was ordering for a lunch meeting, pre-ordered the bowls.

The bowls were made just prior to collection as they were packing up when I reached.

Friendly & attentive service. Reasonable pricing considering the quality & portions. Not that crowded during weekday lunch. Great for families or couples.

We ordered their mushroom jack fajitas & monterey chicken. Both came piping hot. The highlight has to be the fajitas. My favorite at Chili's. From the juicy chicken & beef slices to the flavorful mushrooms topped with all the gooey cheese. Great on its own but better with the tortilla wrap. Sadly they don't give guacamole anymore unless added as a side. The monterey chicken was also good. Juicy & flavorful. Both were very filling. We were stuffed for the whole day. Washed it all down with their bottomless soda & juices.

I purchased a phone case from this shop because my old one was broken. I asked the guy (circled in red) if they had a phone case for the Honor 50. He mentioned that since the Honor 50 is an older model, it was lucky they had one last piece in stock. Trusting his word, I decided to purchase it without asking the price, there was no price tag label on the phone case packaging.

At the counter, he started cleaning my phone screen without asking me first. After that, he charged me RM69 for the phone case—much more than I expected! When I politely asked if there was any discount, he only reduced the price by RM2, bringing it to RM67. I reluctantly paid and left the shop, but after discussing it with my friend, my friend and I felt that the guy ""scammed"" me since similar phone cases are sold on Shopee for RM10-30.

Within an hour, I returned to the shop with the receipt to request a refund. However, the guy refused, saying that once the package is opened, they cannot resell it. I considered reporting this to MDTCA, but the process would take too long. I strongly advise anyone to not visiting this shop. | review_rating:5, text:Good service!

My sister and I just recently purchased innerwear from here (22/4/2023) and the employees there are quite alright, I manage to find my size but my sister took some time in finding it, which she later noticed its not the right size for her on that day when we got back home.

I understand its her incompetence when it comes to choosing something you wear everyday and still able to choose wrong. So we went back to the store for an exchange (24/4/2023) and it's a different staff this time. Though I find this employee to be somewhat irritated due to her tone when she's serving. But the biggest problem was that she secretly CUT OFF the price tag after my sister had finally done choosing the right size WITHOUT informing us and for me, that just leaves a sour taste in my mouth.

I believe staff have to at least inform the customers that they will cut off the price tag due to whatever reasons presents. Either its because customers can only exchange product once or any other reason at all, for the staff to cut off the price tag like that is just another stamp approval of me not visiting this store anymore.

Seating is very spacious and comfortable. Deco is clean and simple with a hint of Japanese design tone.

Now, when it comes to hair care products, Aveda is one of my fave brands. Along with a soothing shoulder massage, their scalp check treatment was very useful in establishing the health of my scalp. My overall satisfaction with their services and goods is excellent. | review_rating:1, text:I recently visited this establishment for a hair and scalp review, but unfortunately, the experience was not pleasant. The staff who greeted us had a sullen face and made us feel unwelcome right from the start. This was disappointing as it's not the kind of experience you want when seeking professional advice.

During the review, the staff member assigned to us couldn't provide much helpful advice regarding the scalp issue we were experiencing. It was clear that more training is needed for the staff to be able to give expert advice to customers.

After we decided to purchase a few items, we noticed a change in behavior from one of the staff members who became friendlier. However, the other staff member still maintained an unprofessional and unfriendly demeanor, which was a letdown.

Overall, the experience was not great, and the staff's behavior was disappointing. We hope that management will take appropriate action and ensure that their staff are better trained to provide customers with a welcoming and professional experience. | review_rating:1, text:I went there for a scalp check but the promoter said they don’t  provide that particular facility in Aveda sunway pyramid , and the best part is they had a board promoting the scalp and hair check.

Don’t miss out this is the place to go! | review_rating:1, text:Good rate but bad attitude.

I went to the G floor branch (next to Parkson).

The first time I went to counter 1 to change A currency, I said I wanted to split two receipts, he said he couldn’t split the transaction and asked me to queue up again.

OK, Second time I went to counter 1 again (only 1 counter is open) and changed A currency.

Seeing that there was no one in line behind me, I said I wanted to change B currency, he said no, he could only change money from one country per person at a time, which means I had to wait until someone came to queue up to change money before I could change money for the third time?

Meanwhile counter 2 is open, then I pointed to counter 2 and asked if I could change money, counter 1 said NO, because counter 2 is new and he didn’t know how to do it.

So does a money changer have such a rule now??? | review_rating:4, text:SMALL MONEY CHANGER IN A BIG MALL. FAST SERVICE.

While the dishes are well-presented and the flavors are decent, they don’t offer the bold, unforgettable taste one might expect from a Michelin-starred chef. For the price, the portion sizes feel a bit lacking, leaving it hard to justify the value for money. A nice experience for those looking to try a celebrity chef’s restaurant, but there are better options for the price in KL. | review_rating:5, text:My husband and I had a delightful afternoon tea here on Valentine’s Day, and it was an experience to remember. From the moment we arrived, the staff were incredibly warm, professional, and attentive, ensuring we felt welcomed and well taken care of.

The ambience was elegant yet cosy, creating the perfect setting for a relaxing afternoon. To make the occasion even more special, a live violinist performed romantic melodies, adding a beautiful touch to the atmosphere.

The afternoon tea selection was beautifully presented, featuring a wonderful assortment of freshly made pastries, sandwiches, and fine teas. One of the highlights was Gordon’s signature Beef Wellington, which was cooked to perfection—crispy on the outside, tender and flavorful on the inside. Every dish was crafted with high-quality ingredients and impeccable attention to detail.

Despite the exceptional quality of the food and service, the price was quite reasonable, making it a great value for the experience provided.

A surprising menu highlight was the Bone Marrow (beef tartare) which was excellent. Signature dishes (Beef Wellington, Arnold Bennett Souffle, Apple Tarte Tartin) did not disappoint. Only underwhelming dish was probably the Black Cod which we found underseasoned and lacking in flavor. Extensive wine list even by the glass.

Food:
The food was nothing short of perfection. The Bar & Grill Burger was a standout, bursting with flavour and crafted to absolute perfection. The Grilled Miso Salmon was another highlight, with its rich, umami flavors and tender texture. To top it all off, the Blackberry Parfait was a dessert masterpiece, refreshing, indulgent, and the perfect ending to an incredible meal. Each dish was thoughtfully prepared and presented with finesse.

Drinks:
The drinks selection was outstanding, featuring a carefully curated range of beverages to complement the exquisite dishes. Whether you prefer a fine selection or something refreshing, the options are tailored to enhance the overall dining experience.

Service:
The service was impeccable. The staff were attentive, friendly, and ensured we had everything we needed for a special evening. They went above and beyond to make my wife’s birthday celebration memorable.

Important Notes:
1. If you make an online reservation, the payment made during booking will be deducted from your final bill, a seamless and convenient process.

2. For Muslim diners, the restaurant offers a ‘Halal’ dietary exception option when making reservations, showcasing their thoughtful consideration for all guests.

I usually get the Torikoku Original, which is a ramen dish with lightweight but flavourful chicken broth. They're always super generous on the chicken - they're so thick and big, and I'd struggle to finish everything unless I'm absolutely starving.

I also love the black fungus topping - it adds a nice crunch, and they give plenty of chopped green things (don't know what it is but it adds nice flavour).

I love the noodles they use too. They're nice and thin, and never undercooked or overcooked. They always taste on point. The chicken broth tastes best hot (always served hot anyway) and is great for rainy days.

I'm surprised it's almost always empty when I come here haha. I think the price charged for the quality of food is very reasonable. I hope more people will come here more often because I don't want one of my favourite ramen places to close down...I haven't found any other place that serves ramen like this 🙏🙏🙏

I went to the G floor branch (next to Parkson).

The first time I went to counter 1 to change A currency, I said I wanted to split two receipts, he said he couldn’t split the transaction and asked me to queue up again.

OK, Second time I went to counter 1 again (only 1 counter is open) and changed A currency.

Seeing that there was no one in line behind me, I said I wanted to change B currency, he said no, he could only change money from one country per person at a time, which means I had to wait until someone came to queue up to change money before I could change money for the third time?

Meanwhile counter 2 is open, then I pointed to counter 2 and asked if I could change money, counter 1 said NO, because counter 2 is new and he didn’t know how to do it.

Straight to the point we ordered their famous wanton noodles and butter buns and they were out of this world.

Their other food items like we ordered such as Luncheon meat noodles and rice , and yam bun were okay at best but still acceptable as they tasted very fresh and weren't too salty which means the limited usage of MSG which is a positive in my books 👍🏻

However, the reason why I'm rating it a 4 star is the delay of the food arrival as I understand there are a lot of customers but the kitchen staff should combat this and push dishes out quicker.

Environment wise, the cafe is very clean and has a vibrant decor which makes it welcoming for potential customers. There is an open window area on the side for people to look outside and embrace the nature where you can even see Sunway University in the distance.

Quoting what that gentleman says ""upgrading a lps for a DC in product makes no sense, as it's not 240V AC in type"" you can't compare.

You are feeling a bit lost here? No worries, I believe he has no idea what he is talking about, they even bash their own product and having the mindset of expensive stuff must always be better. I believe a salesman who works in Hi-end HiFi shop should have the basic knowledge, having someone shytting on the brand they carry just because it's cheaper, and the fact that he doesn't appreciate the difference a good power supply can do in a system even for a DC in product, I don't think that guy is qualified for the job.

Furthermore, the guy is being very impatient and kinda rude, you will get a feeling of they don't want to serve you if you don't bring a stack of cash and put it on the counter to show them you are a serious buyer. Definitely would not buy from such guy even if I like the system.

As someone who has bought from other CMY branch, I feel disappointed with such service was provided.

There are more to add, when I try to test him out if he knows what he is selling. the product definitely said ""analog volume"", which switches between relays for the volumes control. When I bring up this topic, he is very sure that it's a false claim from the manufacturer, he claims that all manufacturers claim so, but it's a chip base digital gain volume control. So I would appreciate that if the salesman learn more about the product they are selling, if you are unsure, don't act like you know all of them.

It still tastes pretty decent and some of the menu options on display do reflect the pinoy influence on the menu options here. All in all, a decent alternative to the competition at the Golden Arches and other similar outlets. Oh, and they have Mountain Dew. Recommended if you've never tried this or used to enjoy their offerings as a kid. | review_rating:5, text:First time tried Jollibees. Love it. Fried chickens taste different from others franchise. Like the sweetness of the spaghetti (suit for my kid). Kinda fond with pineapple juice to cleanse the taste after the meal. Mashed potatoes not too soft and the gravy not thick which I preferred thick. Coleslaw fresh and sweet. Unfortunately service kinda slow. | review_rating:2, text:This isn't my first visit here, but my most recent visit left me dissappointed with the food. I ordered the Burger steak thay comes with a rice and a burger patty. Needless to say, check out my photo to see how depressing that burger patty looks. I had to hold it up with a fork to take this photo or else its so thin that it sinks beneath the sauce. The taste was ok, but portion was really not worth the money.
The only saving grace was the peach mango pie which has been my all-time favourite.
Will I be back? Maybe, but I would go for the Jolly spaghetti or chicken next time. | review_rating:4, text:My first time trying Jollibee yesterday. I ordered a set which had 1 piece of chicken, a burger, spagetti and a drink. And I added an ala carte hotdog so that I get to try a wide range of their food.
The burger was relatively small in size but the taste of the burger meat was pretty nice, compared to other fast food burgers. It had a pleasant distinct smoky flavour.
Am happy they had spagetti because I love spagetti.
The special thing about their fried chicken was their brown sauce which had herb taste in it. And the chicken seasoning was nice too.
The sausage in the hot dog tasted good too - it had a unique smoky taste to it too. The BBQ sauce was a tad too sweet and overpowering.
A bit disappointed their drink was not re-fillable.

A shout out to the sweet server staff who help bring the whole lot of food to my table instead having me go collect to food fm the counter myself. | review_rating:2, text:It is very disappointing that rice and chicken together only got very small portion of gravy, cannot add on extra gravy also, the cleanliness of the seat also quite bad, need to self service to clean up the table and eat.

- Menu changed from beef, pork, chicken TO lamb, pork, chicken.
- if you want beef, need to choose beef, pork, lamb and chicken. (More expensive)
Price increased, which is not the main issue.

THE PROBLEM IS:

Meat quality dropped!
(My partner and I hoped that this day would never come)
First time we came here was in 2023, we thought the quality of meat here was amazing especially for the price range. The pork belly/shoulder and beef karubi used to be so tender, but I can no longer say it is the same.
We are regular customers and we recommended this restaurant to many of our friends and family (because of the beautiful meat quality), but now we have to think twice if we’d want to eat here again.
- When sat down at our table, we found out that even EGGS are no longer part of the buffet. They need to be added on for RM1/egg. So extremely disappointing!!!
- sauces here isn’t very good but the meat dipped in eggs always made it better, again, utterly disappointed with Shabu-yo charging for eggs (?!?!?!)

- kitchen staff is so noisy. Dropping bowls and plates and cheering every time someone drops another bowl/plate. Kinda annoying to be hearing this when seated near the kitchen.

Honestly, all this complaints could be tolerated but then the meat quality dropped, that’s not ok with me. | review_rating:5, text:I love this place.

But when they are chatting while clearing tables their voices are so loud and happy back to customer gave you poker unhappy face.

Kitchen door widely open can see how messy and dirty inside, staff room door open too showing us all shoes while eating is it? The another long hair waitress arranging all the pots banging so loud makes the diners disturb if not happy why not go back home. Ice cream melted, waffle bitter and put there no cover at all. Your golden soup is the worse I've ever tasted too no taste at all, other beef cutting is wrong side making it so tough.

The villa itself was spacious, beautifully designed, and incredibly comfortable—perfect for a relaxing retreat. A special shoutout to Shahmin and his team for their outstanding hospitality; they were friendly, helpful, and truly enhanced our stay.

I genuinely cannot understand why this place gets 5-star ratings. The ride attendants are rude and unhelpful, and customer service is clueless—even the so-called “customer specialists” don’t know how to handle guests. The park itself is old, decaying, and poorly maintained. The shacks and huts are a complete waste of time, and the wave pool only operates for 45 minutes at the very end of the day. The whole place smells bad and feels like it’s falling apart.

For a family of five, we spent $700 AUD—absolutely not worth it. There are so many better places in Malaysia to visit for a fraction of the cost. Even with a quick pass, there was no need to wait for rides, which only made the purchase feel like a scam. The photos online are misleading, so don’t fall for the marketing.

This was our experience in January/February 2025.

From the beginning, I felt something was off, but I didn’t expect to be left so frustrated by the end of the session. The technician didn’t inform me that she was a trainee until the very end, which would have been helpful to know upfront. The lack of experience was painfully evident throughout the entire process.

The session took over 2 and a half hours, which I found completely unnecessary, especially since I was only getting a basic gel manicure with no color. I had specifically asked for nail extensions prior, but I was told that they would take too long. However, even with just a simple gel application, the technician insisted that coloured gel wouldn’t look good on my short nails, and in the end, my nails were actually cut even shorter during the process.

The results were far from what I expected. My nails look uneven, and the entire experience was frustrating and uncomfortable. I left feeling like I had wasted both my time and money.

To make matters worse, the next day, I noticed that my thumb nail wasn’t even coated with the last layer of gel. I returned to the salon to ask them to at least put on the top coat, but when they did, it ended up looking completely different in color because the worker allegedly forgot what shade she had used. It’s hard to believe that such an oversight could happen at a salon, especially with something as simple as a top coat.

I really wish the salon had been more transparent about the technician’s skill level beforehand.

Sesame Chicken Claypot ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Suancai Fish ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Long review:
In my 4th visit, I decided not to go for those chicken hotpot options and settled for a sesame chicken claypot and suancai fish. Yes, even Chicken Claypot House cannot deny the popularity of this dish now in Malaysia and has introduced it into their menu as a seasonal offer.
Sesame Chicken Claypot ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
I thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The sauce was really savory with just enough of that sesame taste. In addition to that, the finely chopped and pre-fried ginger gave this dish that extra fragrant taste. So it was not good for my dieting plan as I ended up having two and a half bowl of rice just because of it. The chicken was also pre-marinated I believe. It was flavorful although the kitchen staff gave me mostly chicken breast.

One criticism I have for this restaurant is its rice. It's very lumpy and has limited the joy of having this sauce on the rice. 1 star for the rice.

Suancai Fish ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
For this dish, it came in a humongous bowl. There's not a lot of fish slices but the quality of the fish is there. No earthy taste unlike Tai Er. For me, that is my number one criteria when it comes to eating fish. To be fair to Tai Er, the first and the last time I was there was about one and half years ago. I hope things have changed now for them. Coming back to Chicken Claypot House's version, the peppercorn soup gives you quite the heat after consuming it for a while. But it was good and I like the fact that the sourish taste did not go overboard as to render it acidic in taste. Another important thing to note is that it did not come with a THICK layer of oil unlike the others that I have tried before. So I did not have to spend time filtering away the oil. So it does hold up well to other restaurants that specialize in this dish. | review_rating:4, text:Soups are super tasty and big bowl .love the fish soup portion reasonable come with 龟苓膏 and herbal tea.

2. Herbal chicken soup: Just okay. The herbal taste wasn't particularly strong, with limited chicken pieces.

3. Fish head steamboat: A new addition to the menu. The dish had a decent taste.

Generally, the food here had a heavy flavor and left us feeling quite thirsty after the meal. It was enjoyable, but we would recommend having a beverage on hand to counterbalance the strong taste. | review_rating:3, text:Indoor aircond environment, not to worry having steamboat even under warm weather.

Now for the food... What can I say. It was really yummy with the lamb stewed to falling of the bone and the chicken was fork tender. The mix platter kebabs was scrumptious as well with just a minor misharmony with the chicken kebab being a tad dry in this symphony of good food vibes.

Food (Beef soto betawi) - This was my original order but I asked to cancel because the beef was tough (tougher than your bully brother lol). Like real tough, plus the ligaments of the meat is everywhere. 😂 I asked to change to bebek goreng.

Came to the store and requested the dress Im looking for. Went to fitting room and started changing.

The fitting room there were no doors only curtain that hang at the door frame to cover.
2 curtains from both sides per fitting room.

Was changing the dress halfway. The owner did not ask for my consent not inform me anything and just barged in and looked at me wearing the dress halfway. She asked ok or not after that and thought Ididnt know how to wear the dress correctly as ifs upside down/flippers over. I said ok then I said I can do it I'm wearing now. Then she left but the curtain was left opened about half.

Complaints:
Did not ask for my permission/consent before coming in.
Did not inform me verbally before coming in.
Did not have my INFORMED CONSENT before coming in.
Invasion of privacy (doesn't matter if they have their clothes on or not)
The cctv was angled outside the fitting room. This incident was RECORDED and there is a solid evidence. If there's none from the footage, I believe you have probably deleted it. But I have witnesses as well.

I've read your reviews and turns out I'm not the only victim that encounter this. You either apologize or might as well shut down the store. With that kind of behavior I don't think anyone would even come and help/support with your business.

I felt to traumatized and speechless during that incident because it was very random and unexpected and I was not even informed. I was so close to burst out in tears full of fear but I managed to handle it well.

So what if you're a female? Does that give you any rights for you to just barged in like that without my consent? You're not even my family member nor friends what gives you the right to treat your customers like that? Did no one teach you how to respect others privacy?

Please fix your behavior. I will not report you to the police but I will make sure others know about your behavior. Either you fix it now or you can start to prepare yourself in court.

I bought a Johnson treadmill from Sunway pyramid outlet. Always face misalignment problem.

Call for service appointments, only allow “one date in a month” for appointment. Ok fine. They set me 12-2pm for service. I purposely take leave and wait for the technician come, until 3pm still no show face and not even a call. I tried call the technician several time only pick up my call. He told me can’t make it!! What? If u can’t make it, why not early inform? Why wait customer to call u several time only inform?

This not the 1st time, last time I wait at home until 9pm also no show face!

I will never buy from Johnson anymore!

Tea Garden Restaurant at Sunway Pyramid is an absolute gem for anyone looking for delicious Halal-certified Chinese cuisine with a great variety of dishes. The food was fresh, flavorful, and well-presented, making for an excellent dining experience.

We ordered the fried rice, porridge, and stir-fried radish cake, and every dish was perfectly cooked with the right balance of seasoning. The fried rice was aromatic, packed with shrimp and eggs, while the porridge was silky smooth with crispy shallots and fresh spring onions. The radish cake had a nice crisp exterior with soft, flavorful bites.

The ambiance is warm and inviting, perfect for families and friends. The service was fast and friendly, ensuring we had a pleasant meal. With their Halal certification, this restaurant is a great spot for Muslims who love authentic Chinese flavors.

Highly recommend for those craving quality comfort food in a cozy setting. Definitely coming back! | review_rating:4, text:Food is not bad. I actually wanted to go to another restaurant but they were having blackout issue so my Mrs suggested this shop and their Radish Cake.

It’s really nice. The coffee was also as how I asked for it, less sugar.

Service is good. Nice ambiance.

🏨 Hotel (3/5)
•	Crowded lobby, long queues for check-in.
•	Late check-in issue – even at 3 PM, the room wasn’t ready.
•	Extra bed charge is RM 189, quite expensive.
•	Parking costs RM 15 even after validation.

📍 Location (5/5)
•	Perfect location – directly connected to Sunway Pyramid Mall.
•	Easy access to restaurants and shops without leaving the hotel.

🛏️ Room (3/5)
•	Smelly sofa, affecting comfort.
•	Slow WiFi connection.
•	Old mattress – uncomfortable, caused body aches.
•	No kids channel on the TV, limited entertainment options.

🍽️ Breakfast (3/5)
•	Expensive – RM 65 for kids, around RM 90 for adults.
•	Very crowded, sharing the same breakfast area with Sunway Resort Hotel.
•	Quite a walk to the dining area – not convenient for families with small children.

Now that I’m home, I realize they are indeed uneven, and even people around me can notice the difference.

This was my first time getting my ears pierced, and I didn’t expect it to leave such a disappointing experience.

It is definitely more pain imo for helix needle piercing in that first injection for awhile. But bearable. I'd done it at Lovisa and it didn't hurt as bad = different type

Price is also quite expensive. So be prepared if you have $$$
RM90 for needle piercing ONE side
Additional RM49 AND ABOVE for titanium earrings selection that are flat back which is great. This one was about RM179 additional for helix

Overall great experience and will come back if I decide to do | review_rating:5, text:just wanted to update: 0 bleeding, 0 redness! i totally forgot i pierced them when i got back home.

finally mustered up the courage to get an ear piercing for the first time. if you're looking for somewhere sanitary, sensitive skin, first timers, safe, Attic @ Sunway is a good choice.

i paid a total of rm300+ for needle piercing (much better than a gun) for both sides, upgraded to titanium earrings (rm45 each), cleaning spray & the cream. 100% worth it.

the lady with the headscarf & lots of piercings (i did not get her name sadly), was very kind, explained things, friendly, gave suggestions & was sanitary and quick.

i was in & out within 10 minutes, ears pierced & with everything i needed. | review_rating:5, text:My go-to piercing place. This is my third time here and yesterday I went to get a double lobe on my right ear. I was pierced by Aisyah and she was so gentle and nice. The whole thing was done in five minutes.

Cuz she messed up on the first piercing and it was too obvious that it wasn’t parallel, the second time was still wasn’t parallel but not too obvious like the first one😑, I took out the piercing around last year November cuz I was so much in pain and itchiness for the whole time, cuz obviously it wasn’t done properly 😑 it was quite expensive almost around RM200 something but I honestly don’t mind to pay RM200 for a good piercing but it turned out to be otherwise !!

They have alcoholic and non-alcoholic options. We tried 2 non-alcoholic cakes, cempedak cake and chocolate valrhona cake. The cempedak cake was an absolute delight - sponge layer was soft and light, while the cream was sweet and fresh. Couldn't get enough of it!

Unfortunately, the chocolate valrhona was quite disappointing. The supposed mousse inside was hard and didn't taste fresh. Actually, the whole cake felt pretty tough and hard to cut and chew. It just felt like i was eating a few days' old cake.

Besides cake, they sell gelato, waffles and other desserts too. It's definitely worth a try. | review_rating:5, text:Their tiramisu gelato is the best tiramisu gelato i’ve had.

Aeroline Penang—Corus Hotel KL

Trip started PROMPTLY at 8:30 AM, no delays. Driver and crew, Faiz was very nice. They helped with check in, seat directory and baggage. The driver was very skilful when navigating through the narrow roads. In one instance, it was a 2 lane road and there was one car illegally parked.  The driver still managed to drive by without even needing to reverse.

At around 8:35, Faiz came down the row with comfy blue blankets and headphones.  The headphones worked great with the on-board entertainment (OBE). The OBE was equipped with many movies and songs, of different genres.

At about 9, Faiz served food to us. It had spicy rice, potato wedges and egg. The food was 9/10, tasty! He also served hot drinks which also tasted great!

The rest of the trip, he went around a few times to collect trash.

There was one stop at a fuel station for 15 MINUTES break.

At about 1PM-1:30PM, we arrived at Corus Hotel. Driver was nice enough to let me take videos of the bus.

2 mineral water bottles with Aeroline branding is provided.

Overall, awesome ride. It deserves more than 5 stars!

Bus Quality:

Can clearly tell that the bus was very well kept. The seats were clean and comfortable, recliner and leg rest was working. Screen was working, WC was also very clean.

The way they cook it is fantastic, and it keeps me coming back. Unfortunately, on my recent visit, the pork intestine was unavailable, which was disappointing. I enjoy both the baby spicy and original flavors, but I prefer the original with extra garlic. However, this time, the garlic tasted off—almost spoiled, which was a letdown.

The soup has been consistently good since my first visit, and it didn’t disappoint this time either. I also tried the cheese mantou today. While the exterior was crispy and nice, the cheese filling had a strange low-quality plastic container smell, and when eaten together, it tasted slightly sour. It wasn’t a pleasant experience.

Unfortunately, the dry hotpot here isn’t great at all👎👎. It’s too bland, just plain spicy and lack of good flavor (i don’t know why they wana add cumin flavor into it cos it’s actually meant for chinese bbq but they added this into dry hotpot which made it really weird). Nevertheless, the mala soup actually tastes really good 👍(but you get the same flavour from Master Kang instant noodles🤣) .

Another thing that put me off  is the so-called member price. It’s free to join then you get discount, but why bother to require that when you already allow everyone join for free. Wasting time and just finding excuse to charge more. Price actually is quite reasonable though. But overall i won’t go back to this brand outlets again. 😅

Finally reminder, when you select the pork or beef, it is usually rolled up so it’s easy to clip, MAKE SURE you tell the counter that you don’t want it to be cut into smaller pieces, my pork belly roll mysteriously ended up as 2 small pieces only 😹.

🎬2025.2.1 | review_rating:3, text:So happy that Lizzie is now in Sunway Pyramid! 🙌 A sister cafe of Lisette's, it offers an extensive array of pastries and cakes, as well as grab & go meals. A 10% discount is applicable to Sunway students and employees too.

Currently an opening promotion is going on which you can redeem a free coffee by any purchase of 2 items! 🌟

Ordered:
Pandan Gula Melaka Cake 🍰 (RM17)
Looks visually appealing, but the taste was really meh; it had a super strong pandan fragrance which overpowered the cake ☹️ the texture was also dry, seemed like it may have been refrigerated overnight so it didn't taste as ""fresh"" so there's a mushy mouthfeel. Honestly, could have opted for other cakes instead within a similar price range.

Crookie 🥐 (RM13)
Lizzie's best seller - croissant and soft cookie in one with a thin layer of chocolate spread inside! Not mindblowing, but the standpoint was the croissant, which retained its flakiness throughout; texture isn't soggy too 👍 Not a must try, but it's worth trying if you would like to have a dessert-pastry fusion!

Iced Latte ☕️⭐️ (RM13)
Got this for free as a promotion! Serving cup is bigger than most cafes I have been to so honestly this is reasonable according to price point 😬

Personally visited the first outlet in NU Sentral and my experience was better, probably due to the items I have personally tried. Ambiance wise, the interior is more spacious than the current outlet, plus it's also easier to find seats compared to the current one.

Though Lizzie has both hits and misses, I might return to this outlet again (maybe) to try out some other pastries. | review_rating:2, text:Besides the nice setup here, I've nothing much to say about this cafe.

The service was quite fast from 1 waiter man but quite slow from 1 waiter lady which can clearly saw her attitude I'm not certain if she has a lot of things on her plate but it was quite unprofessional judging her from her body posture.

I can see a bit lack of staffing or poor task delegations. The waiter be the cashier and serve the customers at the same time cleans the table. That is why only 4star.

I had one of the worst dining experiences at this restaurant. Despite six empty tables, we had to wait 30 minutes just for the staff to clean one so we could sit. The place is clearly understaffed, crammed and the existing employees work extremely slowly—taking orders, serving food, and even handling payments not within stipulated time-frame which leads for congestion and long queue.

Most frustrating and disappointing scenarios is thier very own employee is serving the customers without break time and most of the suffering with empty stomach for accomplishing duty.

The lack of crowd management and efficiency is frustrating, especially for hungry customers waiting for food. If you value your time and good service, this is not the place to visit. Definitely not worth the wait! | review_rating:4, text:Would have given 5 star if not for that poor service. Waited for some time for a table even though there were empty ones but not cleared. One staff had the audacity to ask to move from a bigger table (cleared) to a smaller table (dirty and full of uncleared dishes). She should have the courtesy to clear the smaller table before asking anyone to change table.

Anyway, food was good and portion was generous. Will definitely come back with more people so that I can order more side dishes. | review_rating:1, text:Shortage of staff working when we arrive around6pm during weekend.

The dark colour of the chicken doesn't feels alright to me. But since I've ordered, I just finish it, and see what will happen @@.

The sambal also look different too, now very dull in colour, watery and doesn't have the good sambar chilli smell.

I'll try out another shop that is newly open in the mall instead next time. | review_rating:1, text:Disappointing and Unfair Treatment

I had a very disappointing experience at this restaurant. A group of eight people before me was allowed to dine in, but when I, alone, asked for a table, I was refused without any clear explanation. The waitress seemed willing to accept my request, but the cashier refused. This inconsistency in service made me feel unwelcome and unfairly treated. If there are specific policies about solo diners, they should be communicated clearly and applied consistently. Unfortunately, based on this experience, I wouldn’t recommend this place to others. | review_rating:3, text:Delicious and spicy sambal and dish. Need improvement on the fried chicken and fish.

It shock me to see the food come out this way. Big brand, but presentation and food quality is totally out. Ordered the Sundubu Jjigae RM26 (soup is cook with chilli flakes. Too much, it tends to be bitter), taste like f*&^%.....oooops mind my language, tofu smashed, eggs gone, my jjigae become a pile of vomits (check out my photo & Sakae photo). Kimchi fried rice RM22 (portion was unbelievable small) & finally Kyushu Paitan Ramen Rm20 (Soup terribly oily, noddles overcook, taste wise 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢) . Well, bye-bye & tata to this restaurant. Horrible meal. I seldom give 1 star unless it's really terrible. | review_rating:2, text:Had the worst shoyu ramen today. Soggy noodles, tasteless broth. It's a large portion of noodles, which is usually a good thing for me but with this one it felt like it took forever to finish it because it just wasn't good. Added probably 2 tbsp of their table soy sauce into the soup. It's possible the dish was left too long before it was served, because there was very little soup - maybe all soaked up by the noodles 🙈  Even my husband, who likes his noodles soft, didn't enjoy this.

The kimchi lava fried rice was also mediocre - the rice was mushy (my husband liked it that way tho), not enough flavour so this also had to be eaten with their soy sauce.

The piercing was done by a female staff member with glasses. I specifically told her I wanted both ears pierced and repeatedly emphasized that the piercings needed to be at the same height on both sides. She seemed very impatient and assured me that they would be even. She then pierced my ears very quickly, took the payment, and said I could leave immediately.

Now that I’m home, I realize they are indeed uneven, and even people around me can notice the difference.

This was my first time getting my ears pierced, and I didn’t expect it to leave such a disappointing experience.

-Ketayap 🍩. Based on the local snack “kuih ketayap” which is stuffed with sweetened coconut filling and pandan juice . So yeaaa.. the sweetness does replicate the pandan and the coconut 🥥 filling was a great addition.

-Eid Ketupat🍩. Based on Ketupat prints , which is rice packed inside a diamond-shaped container of woven palm leaf pouch.
The outer layer is colour icing sugar and the inside is a custard cream ... superb bonus 😋

-Almond London🍩. Based on local famous chocolate almond cookies. It has a coat of chocolate 🍫, topped with biscuit and almond crumbles. This is our least favourite among all.

-Double chocolate 🍩. Well this is one of the favourite of all time , Chocolate toppings and chocolate filling 🍫🍫🤟. That’s a double hit combo !!

Currently an opening promotion is going on which you can redeem a free coffee by any purchase of 2 items! 🌟

Ordered:
Pandan Gula Melaka Cake 🍰 (RM17)
Looks visually appealing, but the taste was really meh; it had a super strong pandan fragrance which overpowered the cake ☹️ the texture was also dry, seemed like it may have been refrigerated overnight so it didn't taste as ""fresh"" so there's a mushy mouthfeel. Honestly, could have opted for other cakes instead within a similar price range.

Crookie 🥐 (RM13)
Lizzie's best seller - croissant and soft cookie in one with a thin layer of chocolate spread inside! Not mindblowing, but the standpoint was the croissant, which retained its flakiness throughout; texture isn't soggy too 👍 Not a must try, but it's worth trying if you would like to have a dessert-pastry fusion!

Iced Latte ☕️⭐️ (RM13)
Got this for free as a promotion! Serving cup is bigger than most cafes I have been to so honestly this is reasonable according to price point 😬

Personally visited the first outlet in NU Sentral and my experience was better, probably due to the items I have personally tried. Ambiance wise, the interior is more spacious than the current outlet, plus it's also easier to find seats compared to the current one.

Though Lizzie has both hits and misses, I might return to this outlet again (maybe) to try out some other pastries. | review_rating:2, text:Besides the nice setup here, I've nothing much to say about this cafe.

This place serves a nice one. It is crispy skin, with the nicely tasty seasoned base. And most important, the meat doesn’t have the after taste or frozen meat smell!

You can see we even ordered extra siew yok to savour again! | review_rating:1, text:1.  Spaghetti (Bolognese)
- The sauce appears watery, pooling around the edges of the plate, which indicates poor consistency.
- The sauce-to-spaghetti ratio seems off, with an excess of liquid making the dish look less appetizing.

2. Chicken Chop with Fries and Coleslaw
- The chicken chop looks over-sauced, which might result in a soggy texture, especially if it's fried.
- The sauce consistency appears thin and overly glossy, which might make the dish feel greasy.
- Fries seem undercooked or lacking a crispy appearance, making them look unap

3. Iced Drink - Ribena Longan
- The iced drink has a murky appearance, which could be due to uneven mixing or dilution from melted ice.
- The lemon slice is visible but seems more like an afterthought rather than a deliberate garnish.

Our dining experience was further diminished by poor service. When we arrived, the waiter insisted on showing us to a smaller table, despite us expressing our preference for a larger one. While we understand that some larger tables were reserved, the staff made no effort to check for other unreserved options that could have accommodated us comfortably.

I recently visited this restaurant after being drawn in by a 50% discount promotion. Unfortunately, the experience left me feeling underwhelmed and questioning the value for money. Here’s a breakdown of my visit:

Atmosphere ★★★★☆ (4/5)
The restaurant has a cozy and inviting vibe with wooden tables and tasteful decorations. Since it’s located inside a mall, the air conditioning keeps the space comfortable, making it a pleasant spot to sit and relax. However, the ambiance didn’t quite make up for the other shortcomings.

Service ★★★☆☆ (3/5)
The ordering process is straightforward—you place your order at the counter, and the staff delivers it to your table. While the staff was polite, it took about 10 minutes for our food to arrive, which is reasonable but not particularly fast. The service was average, with no standout moments of hospitality.

Food ★★☆☆☆ (2/5)
The food was disappointing overall. The portions were noticeably smaller than advertised, and the quality didn’t justify the price.
•	Chicken Katsu Cromburger ★★☆☆☆ (2/5):
The burger looked promising at first glance, with fresh and soft bread. However, the chicken was tough and difficult to chew, which ruined the dish. I added scrambled eggs and vegetables for an extra RM8, but they were bland and didn’t add much flavor.
•	Chicken Pepperoni Croissant ★★★☆☆ (3/5):
This dish fared slightly better than the cromburger. The croissant was flaky and buttery, but the chicken pepperoni filling lacked seasoning and excitement. It was edible but not memorable.
The overall taste of the dishes felt uninspired, with no standout flavors or attention to detail in preparation.

Price ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5)
This is where things went downhill fast. The 50% discount promotion was misleading—it only applied if you ordered an overpriced drink. I ended up ordering a Bloody Mocha with Cheese for nearly RM17, which was overly sweet and gimmicky. With additional charges like RM8 for scrambled eggs, my total bill for two people came to almost RM78 after taxes. For this price, I expected much higher quality food and larger portions.

Parking - N/A
Since this restaurant is located inside a mall, parking depends entirely on the mall’s facilities. It wasn’t an issue during my visit, but this will vary based on location and time of day.

Final Verdict: Not Worth Revisiting
With its tricky marketing tactics, overpriced menu items, and below-average food quality, I won’t be returning to this restaurant anytime soon. While the atmosphere was pleasant enough, it doesn’t make up for the lackluster dining experience or poor value for money. If you’re looking for better options in this price range, there are plenty of other restaurants that offer superior quality at a fairer price.
Ideal Times to Visit: If you’re still curious about trying this place despite its flaws, visiting during off-peak hours might ensure faster service and a quieter atmosphere.

The matcha croissant icing is kinda sweet for my liking, the filling is good and creamy.

Thank you 🙏 | review_rating:1, text:ALDO a brand with nice shoes collections but unexpectedly I had a very unpleasant shopping experience at Sunway Pyramid outlet on 7th June 2022. I was served by a sales executive (I’ve forgotten his name, a skinny softie Malay guy) I was looking for a pair of sandals, while browsing around, a beautiful and comfy pair catches my eyes.The shopping experience was unfriendly. We are not welcomed by the team at the first stage. Not even a single word or voice from the so called sales executive during attending me. I’m the one who approaching him and asking for the size availability, asking for the ongoing promotions and things lead into the payment stage at the cashier counter. My shopping was less than 10 minutes until the payment stage. It’s just a pair of sandals cost at RM229 (if I’m not mistaken with the accurate price) The guy passed me an iPad without saying anything by putting it on the cashier directly in front of me. When looked into it ,noted that was a CRM customer details membership form and I just fill in the the details. I have doubt with the “password” column. Therefore , I clarify with the staff “excuse me, may I know why & what the password required for? “ It was unexpected that the staff’s attitude was rude instead of explaining to me regarding my concerns, he took the iPad from me directly key in & reconfirm the required password by himself. What an attitude????
Not even saying anything but showing his annoying face and the body signs was so OMG!!!!
It was really a big turn off and ruined my shopping experience! I’ve changed my mind not to proceed the the purchase. I’ll make it short into conclusion, it was unpleasant shopping experience, very rude customer service manners, staffs training not up to the standard in retails & customer service line. I do hope The Management ALDO look serious in this matter as in brand image & future improvements. | review_rating:5, text:Third time i go here to take a look for a shoe, after that salesgirl named jesselyn, answered my enquires that so much help and cause me to accidentally purchase one of the shoe she suggested.

Then during payment finish she didnt hand out the cookies instead bang it on the counter. There is a difference of just putting down and slam/bang on it. I can hear that sound of bang. I really lose my shit on there and wanted to scold her. I had endured every stages she has showed me , not necessarily to bang my cookies which I bought in MY MONEY not hers at all.

Her friendly demeanor and warm smile made the experience welcoming, and she explained the menu thoroughly, understanding customers’ preferences and offering tailored recommendations. Her attentiveness and professionalism in promoting the dishes contributed to a positive first impression.

I requested it a second time, but unfortunately, it was still served without butter. I also noticed a customer at a nearby table sharing similar feedback with the staff.
4.	When I mentioned this issue to Nicole, she was genuinely surprised and expressed her intention to relay the feedback to her supervisor. Her responsiveness and willingness to address the concern, despite it being a minor issue, were greatly appreciated.

Overall Impression: Aside from the missing butter, the overall dining experience was enjoyable, thanks largely to Nicole’s kindness and helpfulness.

Instead of asking your customer to move, why didnt the staff move instead? Other than that, I was requesting to transfer to other provider. The staff who served me did not even try to persuade me to continue using their services.

Burger had sufficient crust and the meatiness came thru. I appreciate a burger that’s more about the meat and cheese and less about the sauce it’s drowned in. Was better than the one in TRX.

Fries were fresh, crispy and well salted but I’m not a fan of crinkle cut. The 50-50 had a strong lemony taste with a hint of tea. Not too sweet.

Overall not too bad, though go into it like you’re getting a burger at a sit down restaurant, not fast food as the prices are definitely not cheap. | review_rating:2, text:Honestly expected a lot from a burger for this price range I mean its not five guys lol.

Taste was average or should I say no taste at all ? Loads of meat does NOT equal to good food.

Exorbitant price for the burger and it comes on its own ? Bro are you serious no sides I mean at least should mention that on the menu so that we can order the sides together.

Well tried both the normal fries and cheese fries both were below average.

Nothing in particular that stands out except the hype.

In short doesn’t taste like what it looks like. | review_rating:5, text:Located at the entrance of Sunway Pyramid. This is the second Shake Shack American burger restaurant in town (1st outlet at TRX).

The burgers here looks small in size but really packs a punch! Their signature smoky flavours makes it quite hard to stop eating as soon as you take the first bite. Go for their hot favourite  ""Double Shack"" burger and addictive crinkled cut fries. Hot dog is on the menu too.

Wonderful experience with each and every bite! Definitely worth returning. | review_rating:3, text:Not the best, but certainly not the worst burger joint either. Would say that I'd rate Shake Shack a little higher if the prices wasn't so outrageous.
I ordered the Avocado strraky beef burger. Taste-wise, I do l like their burger buns, but the burger itself was lacking any smokeyness or flavor. The ice cream, was just like any other ice cream. And lastly the Malaysia-exclusive Bunga Raya Shake, which was way too sweet too the point that I couldn't finish it.
But other than that, service was great, and the whole place had a nice vibe to it. | review_rating:2, text:I wouldn’t say the best burger in town. I only love the fact the crispy beef streak was good and the burger is juicy and not greasy. The hotdog was hard and dry. I can’t say I like the shake, too sweet and not thick enough.

This service is the worst service you can imagine, it's literally STEALING from customers! HOW can clients be charged so much for such poor service!
I asked for a basic manicure for 48RM, I was far from imagining that this only included nail trimming, no foot soaking, no cleaning, no filing of heels! absolutely nothing, just cut nails, file nails! when I asked the lady who did the pedicure if my feet should not be filed and if it was included in the pedicure, she told me yes but that my heels are hard, so she recommends the medical pedicure (88 RM) rather than the basic one! I thought it would be better, it was worse! She attacked the skin on my feet without wetting them or cleaning them, she just put a tiny bit of emollient product for the heels which she left on for less than 2 minutes, that's all, and she removed the calluses using a special blade. No scrub, no wash, no mask, no massage, no filing, in 15-20 minutes everything was finished and the cashier charged me for 2 pedicures! I paid for 136 RM for just cutting my nails, buffing them a little bit and cutting the callus wich is a scandal!

I was told by the receptionist lady that there was no masseuse available, so I thought a masseur would do because I had requested a 1 hour head, shoulder, and back massage. I told the lady to tell him to avoid from the sensitive areas like the chest and underarms.
We agreed & proceed with the payment.

However, there are a few things that have severely disappointed me:

1. The masseur asked me to lie face down and begin with leg massage. I was confused and asked him, but his response was brief: ""wait"" till he focused on so much of my hip, at which point I asked if he could start with head and shoulder massage?

2. When we continue with the head and shoulder massage, he tends to “massage” my chest, which makes me feel so uncomfortable that I have to stop him right away.

3. He assumed the massage was 30mins instead of 60 mins until I ask him to double check with the receptionist again.

4. I think they need proper training / professional training, comparable what he has done on the right side, but it was different on the left. Either too much emphasis on the right or only for a short time on the left.

5. Overall experience was really bad due to poor communication. Even if you ask a basic question, either no response or unable to communicate. The massage was ineffective as it did not help on my stiff shoulder and heavy head. | review_rating:4, text:Good massage after long day walk in Sunway pyramid shopping mall.

Not only the value is there but the taste is good. A great variety to choose from makes the eating experience better for a choosy eater like me or diner with kids.

This place serves a nice one. It is crispy skin, with the nicely tasty seasoned base. And most important, the meat doesn’t have the after taste or frozen meat smell!

You can see we even ordered extra siew yok to savour again! | review_rating:1, text:1.  Spaghetti (Bolognese)
- The sauce appears watery, pooling around the edges of the plate, which indicates poor consistency.
- The sauce-to-spaghetti ratio seems off, with an excess of liquid making the dish look less appetizing.

2. Chicken Chop with Fries and Coleslaw
- The chicken chop looks over-sauced, which might result in a soggy texture, especially if it's fried.
- The sauce consistency appears thin and overly glossy, which might make the dish feel greasy.
- Fries seem undercooked or lacking a crispy appearance, making them look unap

3. Iced Drink - Ribena Longan
- The iced drink has a murky appearance, which could be due to uneven mixing or dilution from melted ice.
- The lemon slice is visible but seems more like an afterthought rather than a deliberate garnish.

Our dining experience was further diminished by poor service. When we arrived, the waiter insisted on showing us to a smaller table, despite us expressing our preference for a larger one. While we understand that some larger tables were reserved, the staff made no effort to check for other unreserved options that could have accommodated us comfortably. This lack of initiative and effort left a poor impression and made us feel like an inconvenience rather than valued customers. | review_rating:5, text:Came here for a quick lunch.

The condition is that the watch must be presented for the free battery replacement with the old battery regardless whether it leaking chemical or in any condition. Even if you have to remove the chemical leaking old battery, you must keep it for them.

I strongly suggest Swatch Malaysia amend their website to state this condition clearly and also train their staff to advise customers accordingly.

When you're faced with competition from the other bigger chain specs stores, the only way to stand out is with customer service. And both Nelson and Izzah excel from start to finish.

During an initial visit, I tried on many different pairs and was attended to by Nelson, who politely and calmly helped me with my choices. But, I didn't get anything, thinking that I should look around first.

However, I didn't receive the same treatment elsewhere, even though I found something I really liked. And because of that, I went back to Oopa to get two pairs because of the service level.

The range that they have here may not be as much as others, but you feel really satisfied spending your money here for the service and care that's shown as a customer - and that's priceless.

We had the opportunity to experience an invigorating icy-cold onsen at 9°C, soaking just one leg in was enough to make me shiver and go numb! I can't imagine fully submerging my entire body. To maximize the benefits, it's essential to follow the correct sequence, and thanks to Cyrus, the beauty manager, we learned how to do it properly. Otherwise, we might have just jumped straight into the pool without knowing what’s best! 😜

Next, we proceeded through three hot onsen pools in sequence:

1️⃣ Skin Renewal Micro Nano Bubble Onsen (36°C)
🇯🇵 Deep cleanses and provides anti-aging benefits. This was our favorite, as our skin felt incredibly smooth while soaking in the pool.

2️⃣ Revitalizing Hydroluxe Therapy Onsen (38°C)
🇯🇵 Oxygenates the skin and muscles, allowing the skin to ""breathe"" better. According to Cyrus, this pool is perfect for my partner, as her youthful skin benefits from the oxygenation, keeping it supple and radiant.

3️⃣ Detoxifying Salt Onsen (40°C)
🇯🇵 Restores the skin’s natural glow. As per Cyrus’ advice, this pool was best suited for me, especially considering my age and muscle strain in my shoulders. It helped relieve deep muscle tension and provided much-needed relaxation.

Gradually increasing the temperature allows the body to adjust safely, preventing dizziness or discomfort that may occur due to sudden temperature changes.

Throughout our experience, Jane, the attentive attendant, ensured we were well taken care of. She even noticed I was wearing a necklace and kindly reminded me to remove it, as the heat could cause discomfort when wearing gold. 👍

Finally, after a 5 minute rest, we moved on to the Volcanic Himalayan Salt Sauna Room, which was another new and exciting experience. The walls were beautifully designed with volcanic Himalayan salt, known for its relaxation and respiratory health benefits, including relief for sinus issues.

Inside the sauna, there were two levels of benches. We started on the lower bench with milder heat before moving to the upper bench, where the intensity increased. The moment I sat on the second bench, sweat immediately started dripping from my forehead and neck, such an invigorating detox!

Overall, I truly loved my experience here with my niece. Body Perfect is a trusted, government-recognized brand, ensuring peace of mind with proper documentation and signatures to protect both parties throughout the procedure. This added an extra layer of trust to the entire journey.

A heartfelt thank you to Sunway Pyramid and Body Perfect Aesthetic & Wellness for giving me a whole new level of relaxation, an experience I can continue to enjoy, even after returning from my recent Japan trip!

P/S: You don't need to worry hearing the word ""Onsen"", they do provide disposable bra and panty ya. Kind of certain transparency but still rather than nothing right? 😂 And psst..they provide other 100 type of services(facial,slimming, wellness, women care,etc) which you may try out.

It take very long time for them to serve. Second point is the Asam fish head not fresh for the fish head. Got one smell, and the fish got a lot of scale. The only the I feel is nice is the coconut rice smells good and taste delicious. This is the thing you can try.
Overall this visit is unpleasant. Cause other table already serving and we keep waiting almost 40/45 mins. We order around 9 dishes, yet nothing come first. Till we complain with the waiter only one of the ladies apologise. In the end there is a guy waiter who see us very unhappy and provide us the desert cendol.

I was expecting tough beef but it was nice & tender & piping hot. Coffee was nice to complete the meal. Good crowd helped me decide where to eat. | review_rating:4, text:This is my second time dining at this outlet, and the food here continues to be the best compared to all the other outlets. We had dumpling soup, glass noodles with soft shell crab and otak-otak fried rice.

The dumpling soup is a delightful blend of flavours and textures. The minced prawn and chicken filling in the dumplings is succulent and well seasoned, providing a savoury bite with each spoonful. The broth is light yet flavourful, perfectly complementing the dumplings.

The claypot glass noodles with soft shell crab is a dish that truly standout. The glass noodles are stir fried in dark soy sauce, giving them a rich and umami flavour. The highlight, of course, is the soft shell crab, which is cooked to perfection. The crab is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, adding a delightful crunch to the dish. The combination of textures and flavours makes this a must try.

Lastly, the otak-otak fried rice is a unique and flavourful dish. The rice is perfectly cooked and infused with the distinct taste of otak-otak, a special fish cake. The dish is well balanced and not overly spicy, making it enjoyable for a wide range of palates. It’s a creative twist on traditional fried rice that is sure to impress. | review_rating:5, text:You must dine at Madam Kwan’s at Sunway Pyramid. The Satay is the best i have tasted in my lifetime!

We just had to order a second plate of the Salted Fish Fried Rice ! The Nasi Bojari is also the best so far. These dishes were recommended by their staff Ika who is very  friendly and her customer service is unparalleled!  We ended our meal with another recommendation by Ika - Fritters with Ice Cream.

Taste-wise its really not bad and they don't skimp on ingredients.

Ordered chicken kebab today (though I almost got hurt biting into a bone chip). Saw another review here that they also found bone chips in their kebabs. Something that I've not encountered in their other outlets. Perhaps a quality control issue.

The newly renovated stuff'd now uses machine ordering. The machine lagged when I was making payment, and staff were too busy to entertain my problems because Grab riders were more of a priority. After awhile, one of them rerouted the payment to the normal counter cashier (what was the point of the machine, then?)

Waiting time: Almost 20 minutes for a kebab. Not really acceptable considering most customers are here during their short lunch break. Like I've mentioned up there, they prioritize Grabfood more than walk-in orders.

The space is too tiny for the amount of customers that drop by. Best to takeaway.
Probably won't be back in a long time until they've fixed their machines and service. | review_rating:3, text:Update**
Bought kebab today and it's absolutely soaked. Dripping everywhere as soon as I start eating and towards the end it was hard to even take a bite with all the water. Maybe teach your staff to properly drain the vege so we don't end up with damp kebab.

Frequent this place, always order chicken, today first time order beef and regretted. There were 3 bone chips in my beef kebab, could easily had chip my tooth. | review_rating:3, text:so is it burrito or kebab?

if the former, then it simply isn't as good as the competition round the corner.  which is the general dilemma of ""premium"" fast food. | review_rating:5, text:As was ordering for a lunch meeting, pre-ordered the bowls.

The bowls were made just prior to collection as they were packing up when I reached.

It's a hearty meal & with options to add or omit as desired.

The veg bowl option selected is  guacamole (hummus is the other, or can add it with a charge).

The sauces selected were habanero sauce (fiery & it lit my day) & mayo cucumber. The cilantro rice has a good flavour.

Will certainly be back. | review_rating:4, text:[holiao]

The skin on my face is more sensitive and prone to spots than ever. I have started to get breakouts on my chin which I have never done before! My pores are more open I feel which is where the breakouts come from. the forehead also have stubborn breakouts that won’t go even with 2 months on highly rated dermalogica products such as the “age bright serum” which was super expensive yet has done little for my breakouts. Before this acne treatment, my “acne” was hardly noticeable and persistent but after this treatment it is due to my skin being more sensitive. I am extremely disappointed and frustrated. As I am from abroad and was only staying at Malaysia for short-term, I am not able to make a complaint in person or fight to get compensation - so I leave this review to warn other customers. If your skin breakouts aren’t severe and inflammatory, just go for natural treatments. This one was intensive and only made my skin worse. | review_rating:5, text:I have been a member of Aster Spring from the time it opened till present and Tracy (Sunway Pyramid branch) has always been very helpful, polite and I just love her facials plus product recommendations.

They have alcoholic and non-alcoholic options. We tried 2 non-alcoholic cakes, cempedak cake and chocolate valrhona cake. The cempedak cake was an absolute delight - sponge layer was soft and light, while the cream was sweet and fresh. Couldn't get enough of it!

Unfortunately, the chocolate valrhona was quite disappointing. The supposed mousse inside was hard and didn't taste fresh. Actually, the whole cake felt pretty tough and hard to cut and chew. It just felt like i was eating a few days' old cake.

Besides cake, they sell gelato, waffles and other desserts too. It's definitely worth a try. | review_rating:5, text:Their tiramisu gelato is the best tiramisu gelato i’ve had.

When I came back to the store I was served by STAFF NO. 2. STAFF NO. 2 brought me to the customization area to confirm the customization after I had told them the story of me purchasing the letter A. When I was at the customization counter suddenly the customization staff now said NUMBER 1 is also out of stock? To add another plot twist to the story after going back and forth with the staffs there, the same customization staff that initially SAID THE LETTER A and NUMBER 1 was unavailable suddenly said THE LETTER S is also out of stock when I showed him the player’s name and number for the second time? And what would have happened and how would it have been resolved if I went to the Liverpool store again and purchased the number 1 only for the hopeless customization staff to say that now the letter S is also out of stock? :D
( Do note that In the midst of encountering all these 3 incompetent staff and me going back and forth purchasing the unavailable letter at a different store I already showed them the Name and Number I wanted to put on the Jersey ) I don’t usually get triggered or mad at things like this as I am also working as a retail staff and I know how fussy certain customers can get sometimes but honestly it was your staffs fault for handing out wrong information over and over again. Wouldn’t it just be settled if any of the 3 staff actually would have just told me which letter and number was unavailable in the first place? Hence, today was probably the dumbest customer service I’ve encountered in my years of being a customer.

On a happy note, another Female customization staff was working on that day but she was at the upper floor as she was in charge of the redemption counter on that day ( based on the information given to me ) she was the one who apologized and insisted on reimbursing me for the initial letter A that I purchased. Kudos to her for helping out in settling the matter as the other Male customization staff kept laughing and saying that “I don’t know” a million times throughout the whole issue. Felt bad that she was the one who had to take out money from her own pocket when it was the initial 3 useless staff that caused the whole problem with their wrong information to begin with.

According to the female staff, she said that the customization team and the retail team aren’t linked together. So my opinion / suggestion is for both side to get correct information beforehand so something stupid like this does not happen again because it’s quite troublesome for your customers when each staff is giving out a different story every time. | review_rating:1, text:Had a sales guy ( Ashraf?

Without even asking “is there anymore else maam” , not even that she just said this much (to pay) hello i can buy the whole shop if i wanted to do it. There is no manners or whatsoever. Just because i were choosing much more, she removed the glass window (which is normal i understand) but she literally banged that down (glass window) :) i just stared and just start pointing out without speaking because i reallly dont like her and her attitude/manners. Then during payment finish she didnt hand out the cookies instead bang it on the counter. There is a difference of just putting down and slam/bang on it. I can hear that sound of bang. I really lose my shit on there and wanted to scold her. I had endured every stages she has showed me , not necessarily to bang my cookies which I bought in MY MONEY not hers at all.

Additionally, the curly fries were served cold, suggesting they had been sitting out for hours. The root beer float lacked fizziness and was served without a straw, which was inconvenient. Furthermore, the spoon provided for the float was incorrect; it wasn’t the long spoon typically used for such drinks. This experience was starkly inferior compared to what I’ve previously enjoyed at other A&W locations abroad.

Sesame Chicken Claypot ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Suancai Fish ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Long review:
In my 4th visit, I decided not to go for those chicken hotpot options and settled for a sesame chicken claypot and suancai fish. Yes, even Chicken Claypot House cannot deny the popularity of this dish now in Malaysia and has introduced it into their menu as a seasonal offer.
Sesame Chicken Claypot ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
I thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The sauce was really savory with just enough of that sesame taste. In addition to that, the finely chopped and pre-fried ginger gave this dish that extra fragrant taste. So it was not good for my dieting plan as I ended up having two and a half bowl of rice just because of it. The chicken was also pre-marinated I believe. It was flavorful although the kitchen staff gave me mostly chicken breast.

One criticism I have for this restaurant is its rice. It's very lumpy and has limited the joy of having this sauce on the rice. 1 star for the rice.

Suancai Fish ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
For this dish, it came in a humongous bowl. There's not a lot of fish slices but the quality of the fish is there. No earthy taste unlike Tai Er. For me, that is my number one criteria when it comes to eating fish. To be fair to Tai Er, the first and the last time I was there was about one and half years ago. I hope things have changed now for them. Coming back to Chicken Claypot House's version, the peppercorn soup gives you quite the heat after consuming it for a while. But it was good and I like the fact that the sourish taste did not go overboard as to render it acidic in taste. Another important thing to note is that it did not come with a THICK layer of oil unlike the others that I have tried before. So I did not have to spend time filtering away the oil. So it does hold up well to other restaurants that specialize in this dish. | review_rating:4, text:Soups are super tasty and big bowl .love the fish soup portion reasonable come with 龟苓膏 and herbal tea. Recommended. | review_rating:4, text:1. Signature claypot chicken: It was delicious and paired well with rice. The chicken was flavorful.

2. Herbal chicken soup: Just okay. The herbal taste wasn't particularly strong, with limited chicken pieces.

3. Fish head steamboat: A new addition to the menu. The dish had a decent taste.

Generally, the food here had a heavy flavor and left us feeling quite thirsty after the meal. It was enjoyable, but we would recommend having a beverage on hand to counterbalance the strong taste. | review_rating:3, text:Indoor aircond environment, not to worry having steamboat even under warm weather.

Long waiting time during weekend if they did not have spot for 2 person. They will asked if you willing to join table with another customer. Service is fast as not much preparation on their side. The grilling smell is not too overwhelming, doesn’t really stick to your cloth. Overall, all good.

Great spread of premium beef (Angus and Wagyu), seafood, lamb, chicken and sides. Individual BBQ pit with good ventilation exhaust does not leave any odour in the air or on clothes 👍

Service staff were attentive and polite.

Marinated BBQ meats were moist, tender and tasty. Seafood and vegetables could have better been served with some oil/marinade on the side to prevent it from being too dry during BBQ.

Overall nice dining venue and would surely come back again. | review_rating:5, text:Latest Yakiniku in Sunway Pyramid, I like that I have the option to sit at my own mini table, it remind me of Ichiran ramen solo table. The meat quality especially the beef tongue was better then expected and the miso soup quality was also decent. I recommended people to don't skip order the beef tongue despite there's no set for it. It's quite surprise to know that they provide himalayan pink salt instead of normal salt.

The waiter was very professional and trying to make me feel comfortable. He was patiently explain to me about the menu. I also overheard him explain to an old couple behind me for quite a long time without getting annoyed. Big respect for the waiter patience.

I had one of the worst dining experiences at this restaurant. Despite six empty tables, we had to wait 30 minutes just for the staff to clean one so we could sit. The place is clearly understaffed, crammed and the existing employees work extremely slowly—taking orders, serving food, and even handling payments not within stipulated time-frame which leads for congestion and long queue.

Most frustrating and disappointing scenarios is thier very own employee is serving the customers without break time and most of the suffering with empty stomach for accomplishing duty.

The lack of crowd management and efficiency is frustrating, especially for hungry customers waiting for food. If you value your time and good service, this is not the place to visit. Definitely not worth the wait! | review_rating:4, text:Would have given 5 star if not for that poor service. Waited for some time for a table even though there were empty ones but not cleared. One staff had the audacity to ask to move from a bigger table (cleared) to a smaller table (dirty and full of uncleared dishes). She should have the courtesy to clear the smaller table before asking anyone to change table.

Anyway, food was good and portion was generous.

I understand it's a peak season but please don't waste customers time waiting. | review_rating:1, text:The customer service was very cold, odd & bewildering.
The atmosphere as per exhibited by the waitress was bordeline hostile.

Question:

1. Is it the SOP that takeaway customers are not allowed to be seated in order to view the menu & make the selection?

The restaurant was only a handful of customers since it was after lunch hour (1521 hours). Thus, there are a lot of empty tables. In addition, there were no customer queuing anyway.

2. Is it the SOP that takeaway customers is warranted to wait outside of the restaurant while awaiting for the meal to be ready?

It really baffles me that I was not allowed to be seated because I have chose to takeway my meals.

The waitress in a way insisted me to wait outside for my meal, whereas, I have ordered 2 drinks for dine-in (the drinks were noted as takeaway in the receipt, even though I have stated otherwise).

If not because of one (1) of the waiter (a gentleman), I would have to stand outside while waiting for my meal.

3. Is it the SOP as well for the customer to clear the table from the drinks which were consumed as dine-in?
(As aforementioned, the drinks were packed as takeaway, whereas I had it ordered as dine-in).

This is my 1st & final visit to Johnny's (Sunway Pyramid's branch). | review_rating:2, text:The service was mediocre at best, there's a stupid robot waiter with songs playing like its necessary to have it.

we sat at the table near the cash register and behind it is the dishwashing station, while we're eating, the staff kept throwing dishes in the sink with no utmost regard for the patron and making loud noises.

it's so noisy that we can't eat in peace, while we want to ask for more sauce we can see nobody is really looking over the table eager to serve, had to yell to get their attention.

The bra's are expensive but it's definitely worth the service that they give you.
For the first time in my life, the people working there wasn't like. ""Aunty see, Aunty know.""
When I say body positivity, this is the place for that.
They don't mention anything about your size, or how big or small your bust size or cup is. No word about it at all. As it should be.

I've struggled finding the right size that was comfortable for me and my chest. Yes, the ladies might be invasive and touching those places but they point things out to me that I have never noticed before since no one told me. Especially showing me how to wear a bra properly, literally hands on me.

For the first time in my life, I feel more confident in my body - especially my breast. There is nothing wrong with small or large breast, we are all special in our own way :)

The food was quite good. They were grilled and fried nicely, with balanced taste. However, the portion was quite small, considering the price was on the higher side. The Lebanese coffee was  good. Services were good. Staff were friendly and attentive. | review_rating:4, text:We ordered 3 main dishes and 4 drinks. The quality, presentation and portion of the food is pretty good.

Our mix platter were generally okay. My son love the yogurt sauce and I think he complimented it at least 10 times. Lol. The lamb meat is a little on the tough, chewier side. The kebab is also a little dense. Chicken breast cutlets a little overcooked. Hummus needs more olive oil & I would prefer if you don't spread it so thinly on the plate. By the time it is served it almost dried out. Probably just spread on certain portion of the plate and keep it thicker.

The beef burger (served using a pita bread) is good. My only comment is the sauce used in it taste a little like cheap cheese sauce. Otherwise, the nachos, salad are good. The meat inside is flavorful but still also on the dense side. I think maybe is the same meat mixture as the kebab.

The buffalo wings batter is really crispy. The fries are done so well. Super crispy and well seasoned.

The drinks were all great in taste and presentation.

We love the atmosphere and the service attitude. ♥️ | review_rating:4, text:Good menu variety, very unique fusion of modern mediterranean food. Place is comfortable and bright, and service is good. Loved the nachos and especially that dipping sauce that came with it.
Ordered the falafel wrap because it seemed pretty unique. Taste was great but somehow it didn't sit well with my stomach later on.
We got the free baklava set from signing up and honestly it was not too sweet and just nice. Overall, I'd recommend to still give this place a try. | review_rating:5, text:The shop are beautiful and clean. Apparently, it just opened 4 weeks ago. The waiter mentioned that there are a few other branches. The food is delicious.

It was my first time trying Lebanese coffee. The coffee wasn’t too strong and suited my taste. It also had a hint of cardamom and a slightly spiced flavor.

All the staff were very kind and customer-friendly. The prices of the food were quite reasonable and not too expensive. Worth it. However, the downside is that the internet at the shop was a bit weak, so ordering online was a bit slow and challenging. Hopefully, the management will take note of this.

Normally, I drop my parcels at the Mentari branch, but since that branch was full, I decided to use this branch instead. However, I will never drop my parcels here again.

•	Food Haven: Offers an extensive selection of dining options from fast food to upscale restaurants. For Indian food you can try Mantra Restaurant (Not great but decent)
•	Convenient Layout: Despite its size, the mall is well-organized, making navigation easy.
•	Themed Decor: The Egyptian-inspired architecture adds a unique charm, making every visit memorable.

I was served by a sales executive (I’ve forgotten his name, a skinny softie Malay guy) I was looking for a pair of sandals, while browsing around, a beautiful and comfy pair catches my eyes.The shopping experience was unfriendly. We are not welcomed by the team at the first stage. Not even a single word or voice from the so called sales executive during attending me. I’m the one who approaching him and asking for the size availability, asking for the ongoing promotions and things lead into the payment stage at the cashier counter. My shopping was less than 10 minutes until the payment stage. It’s just a pair of sandals cost at RM229 (if I’m not mistaken with the accurate price) The guy passed me an iPad without saying anything by putting it on the cashier directly in front of me. When looked into it ,noted that was a CRM customer details membership form and I just fill in the the details. I have doubt with the “password” column. Therefore , I clarify with the staff “excuse me, may I know why & what the password required for? “ It was unexpected that the staff’s attitude was rude instead of explaining to me regarding my concerns, he took the iPad from me directly key in & reconfirm the required password by himself. What an attitude????
Not even saying anything but showing his annoying face and the body signs was so OMG!!!!
It was really a big turn off and ruined my shopping experience! I’ve changed my mind not to proceed the the purchase. I’ll make it short into conclusion, it was unpleasant shopping experience, very rude customer service manners, staffs training not up to the standard in retails & customer service line. I do hope The Management ALDO look serious in this matter as in brand image & future improvements. | review_rating:5, text:Third time i go here to take a look for a shoe, after that salesgirl named jesselyn, answered my enquires that so much help and cause me to accidentally purchase one of the shoe she suggested.

Ordered a Claypot Thai Milk Coffee.

Was so looking forward to an ""immersive tasting experience"". Unfortunately, none at all! Neither was there any touted ""exotic aroma"" nor ""intricate flavours"". Coffee was mediocre -- lacked strength and richness. Disappointed!

Also ordered Pak Lung's Roti Bakar. Pandan was good - smooth, rich, creamy and fragrant. But roti bakar was squashed as if someone had squeezed it and wasn't well toasted.

Nevertheless, splendid location with good vantage point to watch the world go by. Good pitstop to take a break from shopping. | review_rating:4, text:The aroma is very nice when you are near the shop.
I like their menu choices, habe tried the thai milk tea and butterfly pea milk. Both refreshing and smells very nice.
Only downside is that its way too sweet for me. | review_rating:5, text:Opening Promotion till 11/11/24, buy 2 free 1.

Excellent coffee with a unique flavor where it is fused with Pandan leaves.

The atmosphere is great and comfy.. eventhough there is only 7 table at this shop.. to stop and take a stop is great here.. have your coffee or teatime here..

We walked around this huge n complex shopping mall cos there were so many different exits n entrances. It was like a maze n you can easily lose your direction n get lost. We bought a couple of snacks n then on the ground floor we saw a large crowd queuing up outside a shop. Being curious n feeling kiasu, we went over to have a look. Wow it was Luckin Coffee the popular n famous brand of coffee from China. But why the large crowd? We discovered that they were having a promotion. Only RM 2.99 per cup of coffee of your choice from their menu. They offer a wide variety of coffees which range from RM 10 _ RM 15. So cheap n highly affordable. So we also joined the queue. The workers worked very fast n were very efficient in preparing the coffee. We didn't need to wait long before we got our coffee. They were very orderly n systematic in their operation too. First we had to scan the QR code n then download the app n then register n then choose your coffee n then you make your payment. Finally just wait for your order n then collect your coffee from the main counter. Everything went very smoothly n fast n without any mistakes at all. Wonderful experience for us all to see n watch how this China system worked. | review_rating:4, text:During the launch week, I happened to visit Sunway and was able to use the offer rate to get a drink and handle the queue.

Don’t miss out this is the place to go! | review_rating:1, text:Good rate but bad attitude.

I went to the G floor branch (next to Parkson).

The first time I went to counter 1 to change A currency, I said I wanted to split two receipts, he said he couldn’t split the transaction and asked me to queue up again.

OK, Second time I went to counter 1 again (only 1 counter is open) and changed A currency.

Seeing that there was no one in line behind me, I said I wanted to change B currency, he said no, he could only change money from one country per person at a time, which means I had to wait until someone came to queue up to change money before I could change money for the third time?

Meanwhile counter 2 is open, then I pointed to counter 2 and asked if I could change money, counter 1 said NO, because counter 2 is new and he didn’t know how to do it.

So does a money changer have such a rule now??? | review_rating:4, text:SMALL MONEY CHANGER IN A BIG MALL. FAST SERVICE.

Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and a must-visit for coffee lovers! | review_rating:5, text:Tried the signature maple cinnamon, about what you'd expect sweet but the cinnamon isn't over powering like the sbux variants. The coffee also came at warm temp not too hot which is ideal.
Had the plain sugar donut, so light just like eating baked flour. I don't think it's anything special given everyone can do donuts these days.
The toasted sourdough sandwiches are pretty decent for the price. Only thing was given only 30% occupied still takes a while to toast. Can't imagine what happens on a packed lunch time.
Also customer service at the tables were poor most tables have cutlery, plates lying around and are unwiped.

Service is rather slow, waited for 10 minutes when there’s a really just a handful of patrons in the cafe when we came in. Coffee is served in the paper cup despite they have the ceramic coffee cups displayed (really annoying). Coffee tastes average just like any commercial big chains. Price is reasonable 👍⭐️.

Overall nothing much to shout of besides their maple leaf table 😂 , maybe for anyone still wants to boycott Starbucks this could be an option before Donald Trump makes Canada an American state😂😂",4.4,N/A,"Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Tuesday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Wednesday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Thursday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Friday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Saturday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Sunday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM"

•	Diverse Shopping: With a wide array of shops, it caters to all family members, from fashion to gadgets.
•	Family-Friendly Activities: The mall features an indoor ice-skating rink and a massive arcade that are perfect for kids and adults alike. My daughter loves to play at Parenthood. They have upgraded it too recently and we enjoyed it.
•	Food Haven: Offers an extensive selection of dining options from fast food to upscale restaurants. For Indian food you can try Mantra Restaurant (Not great but decent)
•	Convenient Layout: Despite its size, the mall is well-organized, making navigation easy.
•	Themed Decor: The Egyptian-inspired architecture adds a unique charm, making every visit memorable.

To quench my thirst, I opted for the Teh Kawkaw, which was a strong and bold black tea that hit the spot.

The ordering process was efficient - simply pay and wait for your food to be prepared. The wait was well worth it, as the food was freshly prepared and packed with flavor.

While the dishes are well-presented and the flavors are decent, they don’t offer the bold, unforgettable taste one might expect from a Michelin-starred chef. For the price, the portion sizes feel a bit lacking, leaving it hard to justify the value for money. A nice experience for those looking to try a celebrity chef’s restaurant, but there are better options for the price in KL. | review_rating:5, text:My husband and I had a delightful afternoon tea here on Valentine’s Day, and it was an experience to remember. From the moment we arrived, the staff were incredibly warm, professional, and attentive, ensuring we felt welcomed and well taken care of.

The ambience was elegant yet cosy, creating the perfect setting for a relaxing afternoon. To make the occasion even more special, a live violinist performed romantic melodies, adding a beautiful touch to the atmosphere.

The afternoon tea selection was beautifully presented, featuring a wonderful assortment of freshly made pastries, sandwiches, and fine teas. One of the highlights was Gordon’s signature Beef Wellington, which was cooked to perfection—crispy on the outside, tender and flavorful on the inside. Every dish was crafted with high-quality ingredients and impeccable attention to detail.

Despite the exceptional quality of the food and service, the price was quite reasonable, making it a great value for the experience provided. Everything from the service to the ambience exceeded our expectations. It was a truly enjoyable and romantic afternoon, and we would highly recommend this place for anyone looking for an elegant yet affordable afternoon tea experience. We will definitely be returning! | review_rating:5, text:My husband and I had the most unforgettable birthday celebration here.

They even surprised us with a beautiful card and a complimentary non-alcoholic gin and tonic, which added a thoughtful touch to the experience. Thanks a lot Anthony for your superb service and everyone there!

As fans of Gordon Ramsay, dining at his restaurant was a thrill, especially seeing a photo of the celebrity chef himself on the wall! Our three-course meal was incredible, every dish worth every penny. For any Ramsay fan, this place is a must-visit, perfect for a memorable celebration.

We arrived earlier for pre-dinner drinks at the bar and the cocktails were exceptional - among the best we've had in Malaysia and definitely a strong start to the evening. A surprising menu highlight was the Bone Marrow (beef tartare) which was excellent. Signature dishes (Beef Wellington, Arnold Bennett Souffle, Apple Tarte Tartin) did not disappoint. Only underwhelming dish was probably the Black Cod which we found underseasoned and lacking in flavor. Extensive wine list even by the glass. All in all a great place to go for an evening to remember. | review_rating:5, text:I recently dined at Gordon Ramsay Bar & Grill in Sunway City, Kuala Lumpur to celebrate my wife’s birthday, and it was an unforgettable experience that truly lived up to its renowned reputation.

Food:
The food was nothing short of perfection. The Bar & Grill Burger was a standout, bursting with flavour and crafted to absolute perfection. The Grilled Miso Salmon was another highlight, with its rich, umami flavors and tender texture. To top it all off, the Blackberry Parfait was a dessert masterpiece, refreshing, indulgent, and the perfect ending to an incredible meal. Each dish was thoughtfully prepared and presented with finesse.

Drinks:
The drinks selection was outstanding, featuring a carefully curated range of beverages to complement the exquisite dishes. Whether you prefer a fine selection or something refreshing, the options are tailored to enhance the overall dining experience.

Service:
The service was impeccable. The staff were attentive, friendly, and ensured we had everything we needed for a special evening. They went above and beyond to make my wife’s birthday celebration memorable.

Important Notes:
1. If you make an online reservation, the payment made during booking will be deducted from your final bill, a seamless and convenient process.

2. For Muslim diners, the restaurant offers a ‘Halal’ dietary exception option when making reservations, showcasing their thoughtful consideration for all guests.

The food quality was excellent. I particularly enjoyed their fish head noodle with crab and clams. The broth was simply delicious.

It occupies 2 floors and has lots of seating capacity.  The decoration is rather haphazard, not that it matters when it comes to food and drinks.  The latter I suspect is the main draw come dinner time.
While the menu is extensive (not using the word lightly here!) and mainly promotes Japanese cuisine, there is also a small section catered to Chinese food.  What was a surprise was that they have quite a good range of set lunches as well!  We order the Teppanyaki Beef set, Teppanyaki chicken set, the Sang Hah Mee and a Lala Noodles Soup.  While the lala noodles was just ordinary, both the beef and chicken were pretty good; generous chunks of meat carefully cooked, almost to perfection in teppanyaki sauce.  The dipping sauce completely complemented the meat, being slightly tangy and sweet.  A more familiar chili paste provided some burn, if required. It also came with a plate of rice, edamame, chawanmushi, tofu and miso soup.   The sang hah mee was generous, a large plate of egg noodles drenched with eggy sauce and topped with one very fresh fairly large prawn (into 2 halves).  One is also allowed add-ons, a soup, a drink and dessert at give away prices.  One normally do not expect the add-ons to taste really good, but the mushroom soup was lovely and the ice-lemon tea refreshingly good too!
Although the service is not top notch, who cares when the food, in my opinion is a steal, particularly the sang hah mee.
(Footnote: I recently ate at a “famous” old school sang hah mee stall in the centre of KL and had to pay triple the price for a prawn smaller than the one I had at Yamaguchi.

Made reservation 3 weeks ahead yet when we arrived a table was being set up next to the sink and costume wardrobe....hence had no choice but ask for a change and opted for the couch. While the table was not big, requested that the food is not served all at once...which fell on deaf ears....we ended up having to hold the sharing plates. Again repeated to hold the next dish....waiter just said kitchen prepares all at once...with no consideration there was no space on the table to place the plate. We opted to order cocktails later and moved to the next table to enjoy the cocktails which looked interesting in the pics we saw. Snow whites potion was served as expected...with dry ice etc. Then the 7 dwarfs which tasted mostly like cough syrup. Would not pass off as cocktails at all. Not a hint of alcohol in it. The the Signature.....came in a plain martini glass..When asked why doesnt appear as in image on menu.....was told ran out of dry ice...at 9.30 pm!!!!! And that cocktail too...was BAD! So go for the food and the ambience....don't order cocktails.....and be prepared for unhappy waiters! | review_rating:5, text:Love this place a lot!!!!

The deco and design is in Snow White theme overall quite nice 😊

We ordered Roman Feast set with RM398 excluded 16% tax...the food is still OK......wedges are crunchy....I love the creamy mushrooms soup....however the portion is so so and the set had 2 salad....which we think is not so worthy...included beverage each people only drink 1, and we had 6 people, we spent around RM110 per headcount....which the price might just eat 1 piece pizza? 1 bowl mushrooms?

1) No one gives me a QR code when I sit down. I had to go to the counter to take it MYSELF! The waiters weren't even busy, the restaurant only has a few (5-6) customers.

2) Just as my food was served, I saw a cockroach climbing on my table. I raised my hand for so long (and 3 times) yet no one comes.

The customer service is so bad that I will never come here anymore. I absolutely DON'T recommend this restaurant to anyone. | review_rating:1, text:1. Customer service is out! No greetings, No smile and No explaination given as to how to order etc.

2. Cutleries is dirty and table is not clean when customer leave eventhough outlet is not busy.

3. Ordered their gyudon n yakiniku beef but we felf cheated as the same beef is being used for those menu. When asked their staff, they said oh! gyudon & yakiniku is actually the cooking style (MEANS THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE PRODUCT KNOWLEDGE)! No manager / No supervisor at the outlet. Staff had to call the manager and to my surprise, even the manager do not have product knowledge as to what is gyudon & yakiniku is! Manager blammed on the management. So as the customer i feel you guys are cheating ur customers. Price is different for both gyudon & yakiniku. | review_rating:1, text:Regret. Truly regrettable coming here. Better put other food in my belly and experience great pyramid eateries beside this one. Food is same as other reviewers, disappointing, cold, even for plating they don't put a single effort.

Not friendly, not polite, almost fall down bring my food just in front of my table without any single apologise directly throw the food on my table.

Krispy Kreme Malaysia 🇲🇾 has come up with 3 superb flavours in conjunction of the Ramadan month 🌙. So we managed to try the ..
-Ketayap 🍩. Based on the local snack “kuih ketayap” which is stuffed with sweetened coconut filling and pandan juice . So yeaaa.. the sweetness does replicate the pandan and the coconut 🥥 filling was a great addition.

-Eid Ketupat🍩. Based on Ketupat prints , which is rice packed inside a diamond-shaped container of woven palm leaf pouch.
The outer layer is colour icing sugar and the inside is a custard cream ... superb bonus 😋

-Almond London🍩. Based on local famous chocolate almond cookies. It has a coat of chocolate 🍫, topped with biscuit and almond crumbles. This is our least favourite among all.

-Double chocolate 🍩. Well this is one of the favourite of all time , Chocolate toppings and chocolate filling 🍫🍫🤟. That’s a double hit combo !!

Happy Friday!!!

Had a first portrait hand drawn pastel that was done in Oct 22 - it was decent, so decided to have extra 3 more done which took longer, when received, the strokes of the the new hand pastel art looked different from the 1st received in Oct, looks really good and exact detailing, but on detail inspection - seems like a  combination of digital art and hand pastel? shown to another artists and 'digital art' was mentioned on first look without second thought. My mum called her and queried about the artwork and would like a replacement as she was not happy with it, but the girl say that she can buy a new one instead and deny digital art work by saying 'oh is there is such a thing?' to the word 'digital art'. Sounds very dodgy and would not recommend her unless she is drawing in front of you or made it clear 100% hand drawn. Very disappointed in how this is managed as the response from the girl is very questionable, with possibility of dishonesty and no transparency.

Service is pretty friendly. Seating is both ample and spacious.

The food however is mediocre is both taste and quality compared to the price you pay. Not bad but not great either.

The sake quality is also mediocre, At a range of RM150++, again you get what you pay for.

We still ended up buying because we didnt want the kids to be upset after choosing and trying and confirming their shoes, we ended paying RM87x instead of RM79x.

Samsung Service Centre,"shopping_mall, point_of_interest, establishment","Lot F1.27, Sunway Pyramid Shopping Mall, 3, Jalan PJS 11/15, Bandar Sunway, 46150 Petaling Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia","review_rating:1, text:I am writing to formally lodge a complaint regarding the poor service I experienced at your authorized service centre in Sunway Pyramid. The lack of communication, persistent stock shortages, and difficulty in reaching the service centre have caused significant inconvenience. Below is a timeline of the incident and my key concerns.

Timeline of the Incident:
16 February 2025 – I contacted the Sunway Pyramid service centre to schedule a screen replacement for my Samsung S23 Ultra. I was informed that the screen was out of stock but would be restocked on 18 February 2025. Following this, I requested to book an appointment for 22 February 2025, and the service centre advised me to send my details via WhatsApp. I did so, and they acknowledged my request with a ""noted"" response. Based on this, I assumed my appointment was confirmed.

22 February 2025 – I called the service centre to reschedule my appointment to 23 February 2025. It was only then that I was informed that the screen was still out of stock.

Complaint Points:
Poor Communication – If I had not called on 22 February, I would have traveled to the service centre on 23 February only to find out the screen was still unavailable. Why wasn’t I informed in advance that the stock had not arrived? As a service provider, the service centre should proactively notify customers if their scheduled repairs cannot proceed due to stock unavailability.

Frequent Stock Shortages – Why does the service centre frequently face stock shortages for essential replacement parts? Does this mean customers will always have to wait indefinitely to get their devices repaired? Being unable to use my phone for an extended period has caused unnecessary inconvenience, and potential financial losses.

Extremely Difficult to Contact – I found it extremely difficult to reach the service centre. As an authorized service provider for a global brand like Samsung, the service centre should have a more accessible and responsive customer support system.

The poor service I experienced has been frustrating and unacceptable. As a loyal Samsung customer, I expect better service quality and a more reliable repair process | review_rating:2, text:Left my fold 4 with the center on Saturday, received a call to collect in on Thursday. They claim to replace the screen but I can see that it is still the same screen (there is a slight mark on the screen. It is still there, meaning it's the same screen). They fix the issue with the phone turning off when using the inner screen. However, the center returned my phone with scratches and screen bubbling. They do not handle your phone with care. I suggest take lots of photo and video as evidence before you hand over to them. | review_rating:5, text:came in with a flip 3 samsung that half of the screen was damage, i want to tranfers my data from that phone but couldnt since the screen cant be use. the obvious solution was to replace the flip 3 screen that cost rm1k but i dont want to do that since it was an old phone and already have a new one. however, there was this nice uncle samsung worker who go out of his way to help me, even took out a usb mouse to help me tranfer the data. couldnt be more grateful for the uncle | review_rating:1, text:Brought my s20 to repair for cracked screen but after repair my screen have issues with tapping which it move around itself. Visiting 2nd time within a week and informed that my phone when sent it to them it is already have this issue which supposed I am sure supposed not to be. As luckily I have video record as proof my phone condition before left my phone to them.

The problem didn't been solved and I don't wish to send my phone there again. Now it become my backup phone and I bought another new phone because of their poor workmanship.

Please be reminded they may told you estimated 4 to 5 working days but you still need to chase them for a follow-up and at last can be taken even more than 1 week time to collect your item. Worst thing is your phone's problem didn't get solved after long waiting time.

I am a Samsung users for more than 10 years but tbh if your phone have problems, it is better you find phone repair specialist rather than their authorized service center. Why? because my new phone's screen cracked again and i decided to bring my to phone repair specialist. Price is similar to them but service lagi tip-top. | review_rating:5, text:Am really happy with the attentiveness and the problem solving measures done by the customer service personal.

The soup is not 炖 but a concentrated version. With that I think the price is a bit steep.

The fried egg truffle is definitely over priced with minimum truffle taste. (Went on 20th Dec 2024).

After some time, I noticed that she reopened the counter and served another customer instead of inviting me back.

The food quality was excellent. I particularly enjoyed their fish head noodle with crab and clams. The broth was simply delicious.

Drinks a bit overpriced. | review_rating:4, text:The second outlet of this restaurant, located in The Pinnacle Annexe, Sunway was opened in April 1, 2022 – the main branch, located in Kampung Pandan was launched in November 2015.
It occupies 2 floors and has lots of seating capacity.  The decoration is rather haphazard, not that it matters when it comes to food and drinks.  The latter I suspect is the main draw come dinner time.
While the menu is extensive (not using the word lightly here!) and mainly promotes Japanese cuisine, there is also a small section catered to Chinese food.  What was a surprise was that they have quite a good range of set lunches as well!  We order the Teppanyaki Beef set, Teppanyaki chicken set, the Sang Hah Mee and a Lala Noodles Soup.  While the lala noodles was just ordinary, both the beef and chicken were pretty good; generous chunks of meat carefully cooked, almost to perfection in teppanyaki sauce.  The dipping sauce completely complemented the meat, being slightly tangy and sweet.  A more familiar chili paste provided some burn, if required. It also came with a plate of rice, edamame, chawanmushi, tofu and miso soup.   The sang hah mee was generous, a large plate of egg noodles drenched with eggy sauce and topped with one very fresh fairly large prawn (into 2 halves).  One is also allowed add-ons, a soup, a drink and dessert at give away prices.  One normally do not expect the add-ons to taste really good, but the mushroom soup was lovely and the ice-lemon tea refreshingly good too!
Although the service is not top notch, who cares when the food, in my opinion is a steal, particularly the sang hah mee.
(Footnote: I recently ate at a “famous” old school sang hah mee stall in the centre of KL and had to pay triple the price for a prawn smaller than the one I had at Yamaguchi.

I love that they're always adding and updating more new books, and that they regularly have promotions going on.

However, sometimes they have too many overlapping promotions that even their system cannot handle and the staff are not familiar with. There have been too many instances where I find same books (same publication, size etc), but they're tagged different prices. Some books are tagged a certain amount but when I got to the counter, they said they were tagged wrongly and the price was actually higher than displayed by the tag.

As a regular patron, this had happened too many times especially when they have many different promotions at the same time (ie all books for 20% for 2 books or more but they also have 10% on fiction so if you buy fiction, even if you buy 2 books or more, you're only entitled to get 10% each). This makes the shopping experience here very unpleasant. The only way to know for sure how much you have to pay exactly is by checking at the counter, which is troublesome especially if there's large crowd.

However, other than this, I really like this outlet because of the variety of books available.

•	Diverse Shopping: With a wide array of shops, it caters to all family members, from fashion to gadgets.

This dish, priced from RM19.50, is a true indulgence. It features crispy, slightly spicy fried chicken served flat out, accompanied by their incredibly flavorful braised sauce and a bed of tofu rice. This combination of textures and flavors is nothing short of addictive.

The Taiwanese Hot Crispy Chicken Rice Set doesn't stop at the chicken alone; it includes a full meal experience. Alongside the crispy chicken, you'll find a serving of braised sauce-topped rice, with the option to add a braised egg, tofu, or both, depending on your preference. To complete the meal, it even comes with a refreshing bubble milk tea.

For those looking to elevate their culinary adventure, an extra plate of Taiwanese sausage is a wise choice. When everything is combined and generously topped with their garlicy chili sambal paste, the flavors harmonize in a symphony of deliciousness that's sure to leave your taste buds dancing.

The bra's are expensive but it's definitely worth the service that they give you.
For the first time in my life, the people working there wasn't like. ""Aunty see, Aunty know.""
When I say body positivity, this is the place for that.
They don't mention anything about your size, or how big or small your bust size or cup is. No word about it at all. As it should be.

I've struggled finding the right size that was comfortable for me and my chest. Yes, the ladies might be invasive and touching those places but they point things out to me that I have never noticed before since no one told me. Especially showing me how to wear a bra properly, literally hands on me.

For the first time in my life, I feel more confident in my body - especially my breast. There is nothing wrong with small or large breast, we are all special in our own way :)

•	Food Haven: Offers an extensive selection of dining options from fast food to upscale restaurants. For Indian food you can try Mantra Restaurant (Not great but decent)
•	Convenient Layout: Despite its size, the mall is well-organized, making navigation easy.
•	Themed Decor: The Egyptian-inspired architecture adds a unique charm, making every visit memorable.

We had the opportunity to experience an invigorating icy-cold onsen at 9°C, soaking just one leg in was enough to make me shiver and go numb! I can't imagine fully submerging my entire body. To maximize the benefits, it's essential to follow the correct sequence, and thanks to Cyrus, the beauty manager, we learned how to do it properly. Otherwise, we might have just jumped straight into the pool without knowing what’s best! 😜

Next, we proceeded through three hot onsen pools in sequence:

1️⃣ Skin Renewal Micro Nano Bubble Onsen (36°C)
🇯🇵 Deep cleanses and provides anti-aging benefits. This was our favorite, as our skin felt incredibly smooth while soaking in the pool.

2️⃣ Revitalizing Hydroluxe Therapy Onsen (38°C)
🇯🇵 Oxygenates the skin and muscles, allowing the skin to ""breathe"" better. According to Cyrus, this pool is perfect for my partner, as her youthful skin benefits from the oxygenation, keeping it supple and radiant.

3️⃣ Detoxifying Salt Onsen (40°C)
🇯🇵 Restores the skin’s natural glow. As per Cyrus’ advice, this pool was best suited for me, especially considering my age and muscle strain in my shoulders. It helped relieve deep muscle tension and provided much-needed relaxation.

Gradually increasing the temperature allows the body to adjust safely, preventing dizziness or discomfort that may occur due to sudden temperature changes.

Throughout our experience, Jane, the attentive attendant, ensured we were well taken care of. She even noticed I was wearing a necklace and kindly reminded me to remove it, as the heat could cause discomfort when wearing gold. 👍

Finally, after a 5 minute rest, we moved on to the Volcanic Himalayan Salt Sauna Room, which was another new and exciting experience. The walls were beautifully designed with volcanic Himalayan salt, known for its relaxation and respiratory health benefits, including relief for sinus issues.

Inside the sauna, there were two levels of benches. We started on the lower bench with milder heat before moving to the upper bench, where the intensity increased. The moment I sat on the second bench, sweat immediately started dripping from my forehead and neck, such an invigorating detox!

Overall, I truly loved my experience here with my niece. Body Perfect is a trusted, government-recognized brand, ensuring peace of mind with proper documentation and signatures to protect both parties throughout the procedure. This added an extra layer of trust to the entire journey.

A heartfelt thank you to Sunway Pyramid and Body Perfect Aesthetic & Wellness for giving me a whole new level of relaxation, an experience I can continue to enjoy, even after returning from my recent Japan trip!

P/S: You don't need to worry hearing the word ""Onsen"", they do provide disposable bra and panty ya. Kind of certain transparency but still rather than nothing right? 😂 And psst..they provide other 100 type of services(facial,slimming, wellness, women care,etc) which you may try out.

I love that they're always adding and updating more new books, and that they regularly have promotions going on.

However, sometimes they have too many overlapping promotions that even their system cannot handle and the staff are not familiar with. There have been too many instances where I find same books (same publication, size etc), but they're tagged different prices. Some books are tagged a certain amount but when I got to the counter, they said they were tagged wrongly and the price was actually higher than displayed by the tag.

As a regular patron, this had happened too many times especially when they have many different promotions at the same time (ie all books for 20% for 2 books or more but they also have 10% on fiction so if you buy fiction, even if you buy 2 books or more, you're only entitled to get 10% each). This makes the shopping experience here very unpleasant. The only way to know for sure how much you have to pay exactly is by checking at the counter, which is troublesome especially if there's large crowd.

The seller was communicative and professional from start to finish, making the entire process smooth and enjoyable.

Before finalizing the purchase, I had a discussion with him regarding the laptop, its specifications, and additional items. He was knowledgeable, patient, and happy to address my questions. As part of the deal, I also received a laptop bag and a complimentary pen drive, which added great value to the purchase.

What stood out most was his approach—he wasn’t pushy or overly eager to close the deal. Instead, he gave me ample space and time to make an informed decision, which I truly appreciated. His cool and professional demeanor made it easy to trust his recommendations and services.

The Asus Zenbook 14 OLED itself is a fantastic device—sleek, powerful, and visually stunning with its OLED display. Coupled with the seller's outstanding service, it was a purchase I’m very satisfied with.

We ordered tea and dessert, which tastes really good and reasonable to the pricing. However, management needs to put in the time to train their employees to elevate the place.

I looked at the menu and saw so many different types of teas. This is for people who are willing to pay the money to try out nuances between different types of teas.
The place presents itself as a more sophisticated place, not just your regular cafe. So, I asked the waitress for recommendations.

To my disappointment, the waitresses there were clearly part-timers hired to only serve tables. They also didn't have a person dedicated to recommend teas or talk about why is it brewed a certain way.

This should have been the selling point of the place-- yet it is not fully utilized.

From this experience, it goes from a potential spot for tea lovers who want to try different types of teas-- to suddenly just a regular cafe.

To be honest, the staff were polite, I find no fault in the service itself. I just can tell that no further training was given for them -- or 1 dedicated person -- to make the experience better. Again, I wouldn't write this much if it's just a regular cafe.

I can see that there is potential, and I can tell what the initial vision was.  I hope to see the place improve over time, or, to accept the route of being a regular cafe, where customers will start to ask about the price versus what you're getting.

It's a puzzle-based escape room experience with different themed rooms, each with its own unique story. We tried the ""Saving King Arthur"" room, which involved rescuing a king, and ""The Harvest,"" a backstory with missing organs—both were creative and engaging! The difficulty levels and physical activity vary per room, and even though we chose the lower difficulty ones, they still tested our brainpower quite a bit! 😂 We managed to escape both rooms we attempted, which was a great accomplishment for us. You’re also allowed up to three clues from the staff, which definitely helped without giving too much away.

Speaking of the staff, Elisha and Ken were fantastic,both were super helpful and polite throughout. Whenever we got stuck, they provided just the right amount of micro clues, letting us figure things out without spoiling the puzzles. I really appreciated that. They were also knowledgeable and answered all our questions with ease.

Overall, it was a fun and interesting experience, and I thoroughly enjoyed it with my siblings.

A big thank you to Sunway for allowing us to check in early at 11 AM instead of the usual 2 PM. This thoughtful gesture made our trip so much smoother, as we could head straight to the theme park without worrying about our belongings.

The villa itself was spacious, beautifully designed, and incredibly comfortable—perfect for a relaxing retreat. A special shoutout to Shahmin and his team for their outstanding hospitality; they were friendly, helpful, and truly enhanced our stay. While the food was decent, it could be improved to match the overall high standards of the experience.

Overall, we would rate our stay 8.5/10 and would definitely consider returning. Thank you, Sunway, for a wonderful time! | review_rating:1, text:Disappointing Experience – Not Worth the Money

I genuinely cannot understand why this place gets 5-star ratings. The ride attendants are rude and unhelpful, and customer service is clueless—even the so-called “customer specialists” don’t know how to handle guests. The park itself is old, decaying, and poorly maintained. The shacks and huts are a complete waste of time, and the wave pool only operates for 45 minutes at the very end of the day. The whole place smells bad and feels like it’s falling apart.

For a family of five, we spent $700 AUD—absolutely not worth it. There are so many better places in Malaysia to visit for a fraction of the cost. Even with a quick pass, there was no need to wait for rides, which only made the purchase feel like a scam. The photos online are misleading, so don’t fall for the marketing.

This was our experience in January/February 2025.

The cinnabun taste as good as before when the open in NU sentral and i have bought many times from there when i passed by however when i tried once from sunway pyramid ,the cinnabon taste is completely different , it does not taste like previous, the bun is very hard and dry, just like some cinamon bread i can get from any bakery shop. afterwards, I give another chance to get from Nu sentral again and thought its was the outlet issues , unfortunately the taste is just worse like sunway pyramid.

Cinnabon isn’t cheap and quite pricy for many people, so when we get this type of low quality food will double the disappointment… hope the owner can have a quality control and dont use cheap flour just to earn more money! | review_rating:4, text:Biscoff mini cinnamon was good .

Or is it a fly laid eggs on it thats why it has those white things? Don’t say they are sesame seed also because they are smaller than that. I’ve asked a chef that has been dealing with frozen squid rings for years, he mentioned he never seen such thing before.

Third photo is an example of fly eggs (zoomed in) that was sent by my friend that works in pest control company. Not sure if its the same thing found on the squid, but better be safe than sorry.

Last visit for Dubuyo outlets. | review_rating:4, text:Great food options with affordable prices and set menus available too.

Got the honey garlic chicken lunch set. Portion is worth the price.
But while the food was still tasty, the chicken did not actually taste like honey garlic. Food presentation for this dish could be improved. The iced barley tea was also extremely watered down. Tasted like nothing but ice water.

Would still come back but maybe try a different dish.

The soondubu and ramyeon looked good. | review_rating:5, text:Great place!

On 2nd of February 2019, at 8:58 I had a nasty encounter with 3 cashiers with foul attitudes towards me wanting to swap my change for a better note (the one they gave me had a significantly big hole on it) as not all stores accept torn notes. The male cashier (MUHD SYAFIQ) pretended to exchange the note but instead gave me the same one with a hole (he covered it with his fingers). The other male (AHMAD AMNAN) who was in charge of handling my purchase completely ignored my request to change notes and walked off. Not only are the staff ignorant and dishonest, a female salesperson/cashier (idrk) mocked at my request to change notes. She even made the comment saying ""It is still accepted"" and continued to make rude comments on me to her co-workers.

These behaviors are not what staff who are working at the service industry should have.

There’s a small seating area where you can unwind and take in the ambiance.

Tried the Coconut Mango Boom, and it was truly a decent drink! The combination of coconut and mango was refreshing, making it a perfect choice for a warm day. What really stood out to me was the ability to customize the sugar level, which is a thoughtful touch. It’s great to have the option to adjust sweetness according to personal preference; this kind of flexibility is often hard to find in many bubble tea shops.

As for the pricing, I found it quite reasonable for the quality of the drinks. | review_rating:1, text:I already order with this girl two time!

When I at the counter, a Malay male staff was very occupied with his mobile phone, obviously personal events as I can hear his voice messages. He ignored and walk in customer. I was later attended by another short hair lady that was doing her paperwork. She appears to be lack of product knowledge, questions posted such as which one is less milky taste, what’s inside an orange/cherry choc (half pure orange half pure cherry? Or mixture of these flavour?), her reply is “I don’t know, I don’t know”. Seriously? However, she is polite. Until payment, the male staff still on his phone. So I left the choc at store and returned to pick up my choc after two hours, I was attended by the male staff, he is STILL busy with his voice messages. While attending to me, his hand still swiping his phone. This is unacceptable. The staffs really need to be polished to serve such premium brand chocolates, and trained on what is customer service.",4.4,+60 3-5612 2020,"Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Tuesday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Wednesday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Thursday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Friday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Saturday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Sunday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM"

Palsaik is the whole package in terms of the quality of their meats and their sides. I've never had a bad time going to Palsaik and always leave satisfied. The service is also excellent as servers are constantly nearby. They cook for you as well, and they do a good job at it, too. This particular branch is really nice as it's the most spacious I've seen. They also have a nice kids' room attached to the restaurant.

Also got the vegetable pancake, which was super crispy and delicious!

The staff were friendly and attentive, and the biggest win? We walked out not smelling like oil or smoky bbq. You know that scent that usually clings to your clothes after Korean BBQ? None of that here!

The taste of food is average according to my own preference. The menu did mention about the weight of the pork slice for 2 pax but personally think it’s small portion 😅 I definitely pork lover hence the portion is small for me.

Yummy yoghurt ice cream and it’s free flow, so with the bancan!

Overall happy with the dine in experience! One suggestion is if there is more choices for kid menu, that’s definitely perfect as it’s limited choice for toddler. | review_rating:5, text:First time invited by my friends in this place.. will be come again for bring my family due to play room provided for parents eating with peace.

Very uncomparation with other BBQ and hot pot restaurant perfect matching 2 in 1 set , affordable price and enjoying unlimited free desert ice cream with quality yoghurt ice cream free flow.. The pity of staff restaurant keeps refilling until the machine needs time to freeze ice cream. But lucky with display-hanging
""Notice preparation on progress."" Good practise every 5-7minutes. I still can enjoy the ice cream!

I also never expected free-flow side dishes/vegetables in here , Normally, we ask only to provide as normal restaurants practise.

Good to gain memory. At least, this is my future place for dine perfect combination. Never try, Never know.

Impressive in detailing informing customers service from time being, Even busy weekend still manageable but still feel provide services.

No choice. I've to become a regular guest here as a service provider, and alertness attention from the manager meets up my expectations.

As Mention enjoy peacefully, play room is temptation for me.. hehe.

Food is quite affordable price and has more choices for me in different varieties of BBQ, even Ala Carte.  Good space and large table suitable for family gatherings, so far this  place is the most plenty big table. But lucky do a reservation early.

You also cannot go wrong with the Sugar Raised donuts and honestly only getting one was not enough. I would definitely try more flavours next time since I really enjoyed my late afternoon snack :) | review_rating:1, text:A Disappointing Experience

I recently visited a Dunkin' Donuts outlet and was left feeling frustrated and disappointed by the customer service.

When I was deciding on my order, the staff member insisted that I purchase four donuts to receive a box. While I understand the desire to minimize waste, it felt inflexible and inconvenient, especially for a smaller order.

Moreover, the lack of a larger bag to carry the individual paper bags was surprising. It seemed like a minor detail, but it added to the overall inconvenience of the experience.

While Dunkin' Donuts has historically offered boxes for smaller orders, this recent experience suggests a potential downgrade in customer service. It's important to remember that good customer service can significantly impact a customer's overall satisfaction.

I hope that Dunkin' Donuts will take steps to improve their customer service policies and training to ensure a more positive experience for future customers. | review_rating:3, text:Sweet treat is not for me, but I do drop here to pack these colourful, vibrant, attractive and hunger calling donuts.

It was full of different types of goods ranging from cosmetics, household, clothes, kitchen utensils n cutlery,stationery to even food n beverage. You name it n you can find almost anything here. No wonder so many people like to shop here. The prices are really reasonable n most items are usually priced at only RM 5.90 only. Except for other bigger n more expensive items- these come with a higher price. You can shop at your own leisure without any sales person breathing down your neck.

This store is popular among young people, student, foreigner & tourist, especially female. Even though, the Japanese Yen had been down to the Forex rate of 3.0 but the price is never down but keep on increasing.

•	Diverse Shopping: With a wide array of shops, it caters to all family members, from fashion to gadgets.

•	Food Haven: Offers an extensive selection of dining options from fast food to upscale restaurants. For Indian food you can try Mantra Restaurant (Not great but decent)
•	Convenient Layout: Despite its size, the mall is well-organized, making navigation easy.
•	Themed Decor: The Egyptian-inspired architecture adds a unique charm, making every visit memorable.

To make matters worse, she made inappropriate comments, even body-shaming customers.

Although the dresses sold here are beautiful and reasonably priced between RM100-250, I decided not to make a purchase because of this sales assistant's rude behavior.

The food tastes good but leans towards a heavier and oilier base. If you can't handle spicy food, I’d recommend avoiding the dishes I ordered.

Portion-wise, the servings are generous, but the pricing is on the higher side. For example, the medium-sized Spicy Sour Soup Dory Fish costs RM108, but it's enough to be shared among four ladies. The 双椒辣子鸡 costs RM49, which I find a bit overpriced because the chicken cubes are really small and mixed with other ingredients. Based on the taste, I believe they’ve added fried potato cubes, so most of the dish consists of vegetables—mainly two types of chili and potato cubes. The potato is fine to eat, but the chili depends on your spice tolerance.

Service-wise, I was impressed. They have a unique way of calling for staff using a peace ✌🏻 hand sign, which I found interesting (but personally for me as an introverted person, I was really shy to do it). The service team was attentive and had a good attitude.

I might return, but I’d definitely bring at least two more friends to share the portions—if you're a small eater, you won’t be able to finish everything on your own! | review_rating:5, text:Today finally managed to get a chance to dine here after 2 times failed to get in for the past 1 year.

The chicken in spicy 🌶 oil is worth trying whereas the prawns with fen si is savory but a bit oily as well. The veggies was normal but the fried chicken with sweet & sour sauce was worth the try.

The flavors were well-balanced, and the fresh ingredients made for a hearty and satisfying bite. Accompanying my meal was the Lemongrass Mojito, an incredibly refreshing drink that was the perfect antidote to the sweltering afternoon heat.

Personally the dishes aren't quite my taste, everything seems a bit bland or not much flavor n  too oily for me either grilled or fried dish.

overall the food was okay. A bit pricey for the boba taufufa. such a small bowl for like the price of Rm 20.

For the snowflake strawberry yogurt, it was too high and when you eat it, it will just drop on the tray. So just keep in mind it’s very high risk in wastage. | review_rating:1, text:Not worth it!!! Not worth the price!!!

On the 21/11/2024, I bought my AirPods 4 in Nu Sentral @ Machines.
However, on the 29/11/2024, I found out that my left side AirPods had this windy sound which should not be there. I went to the nearest Machines and they told me that I have to go for their service provider, which the nearest is Sunway Pyramid for me.

First Visit (29/11): After getting my AirPods diagnosed, the staff and the technician said it was fine. I was very doubtful, and I left. BUT! The issue came back again! So, I booked another appointment with the service provider.

Second Visit (30/11): I left my AirPods with them again and I agreed to the 3-7 days checking.

Third Visit (3/12): I was told that my AirPods were fine. SHOCKED with the outcome, I tested the AirPods in front of them and the issue is STILL THERE. I even told the staff to try it out, and the staff let the technician tried it out too.
Guess what? THEY JUST CONFIRMED THE ISSUE RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

I was like: Wait, I waited FOR NOTHING.

The pissed off moment was: Even though I bought my AirPods on the 21/11, I have not done ANY damages to it (why would I? RM829 weyh), I solely DESERVE a full-on exchange of the product.

But? The service provider staff SAID NO. You have to leave the AirPods 4 AGAIN to check if the issue persists.

I was like: WAIT. HOLD UP. You just confessed that there IS an issue. Why do you need to wait for it again?
I demanded a full-on exchange of the ENTIRE product. The staff had to go back and called the manager (WHO, BY THE WAY, HE/SHE ISN’T EVEN IN THE OFFICE).
Furiously, I demanded to talk to the manager on the phone, but the staff refused to.
After the bickering, the staff went back in the room, came out, and agreed to swap THE LEFT SIDE OF THE AIRPODS 4.
I was like, NO WAY. I am entitled to have a full exchange of the product.

Conclusion:-
1. I am still waiting for another 3-7 days.
2. I want a full-on exchange (didn’t get it)
3. And the manager isn’t there at all.

Unprofessional and betrayed by the service of Machines and this service provider.

I will keep on updating my complaint.

Tea Garden Restaurant at Sunway Pyramid is an absolute gem for anyone looking for delicious Halal-certified Chinese cuisine with a great variety of dishes. The food was fresh, flavorful, and well-presented, making for an excellent dining experience.

We ordered the fried rice, porridge, and stir-fried radish cake, and every dish was perfectly cooked with the right balance of seasoning. The fried rice was aromatic, packed with shrimp and eggs, while the porridge was silky smooth with crispy shallots and fresh spring onions. The radish cake had a nice crisp exterior with soft, flavorful bites.

The ambiance is warm and inviting, perfect for families and friends. The service was fast and friendly, ensuring we had a pleasant meal. With their Halal certification, this restaurant is a great spot for Muslims who love authentic Chinese flavors.

Highly recommend for those craving quality comfort food in a cozy setting. Definitely coming back! | review_rating:4, text:Food is not bad. I actually wanted to go to another restaurant but they were having blackout issue so my Mrs suggested this shop and their Radish Cake.

It’s really nice. The coffee was also as how I asked for it, less sugar.

There is plenty of other dishes which I wanted to try out but I didn’t have much time to couldn’t try others.

Service is good. Nice ambiance.

On the 21/11/2024, I bought my AirPods 4 in Nu Sentral @ Machines.
However, on the 29/11/2024, I found out that my left side AirPods had this windy sound which should not be there. I went to the nearest Machines and they told me that I have to go for their service provider, which the nearest is Sunway Pyramid for me.

First Visit (29/11): After getting my AirPods diagnosed, the staff and the technician said it was fine. I was very doubtful, and I left. BUT! The issue came back again! So, I booked another appointment with the service provider.

Second Visit (30/11): I left my AirPods with them again and I agreed to the 3-7 days checking.

Third Visit (3/12): I was told that my AirPods were fine. SHOCKED with the outcome, I tested the AirPods in front of them and the issue is STILL THERE. I even told the staff to try it out, and the staff let the technician tried it out too.
Guess what? THEY JUST CONFIRMED THE ISSUE RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

I was like: Wait, I waited FOR NOTHING.

The pissed off moment was: Even though I bought my AirPods on the 21/11, I have not done ANY damages to it (why would I? RM829 weyh), I solely DESERVE a full-on exchange of the product.

But? The service provider staff SAID NO. You have to leave the AirPods 4 AGAIN to check if the issue persists.

I was like: WAIT. HOLD UP. You just confessed that there IS an issue. Why do you need to wait for it again?
I demanded a full-on exchange of the ENTIRE product. The staff had to go back and called the manager (WHO, BY THE WAY, HE/SHE ISN’T EVEN IN THE OFFICE).
Furiously, I demanded to talk to the manager on the phone, but the staff refused to.
After the bickering, the staff went back in the room, came out, and agreed to swap THE LEFT SIDE OF THE AIRPODS 4.
I was like, NO WAY. I am entitled to have a full exchange of the product.

Conclusion:-
1. I am still waiting for another 3-7 days.
2. I want a full-on exchange (didn’t get it)
3. And the manager isn’t there at all.

Unprofessional and betrayed by the service of Machines and this service provider.

I will keep on updating my complaint.

To be honest, among these 2, still prefer Tonkotsu.More cheaper & tasty in my opinion.
Kiwami very oily & not thick enough the taste.
Adding tamago egg & osen tamago egg with RM4 & RM3 respectively.
Honey Almond sago with mint taste good and refreshing.
Recommended for those who would like to eat ramen can give it a try. | review_rating:4, text:Food & Price:

Total price: RM101.95 (incld 16% tax)

1. Ramen Bankara - RM25.90 - The soup is strong with pork broth, it really comes from the pork bone essence. Taste very nice and ramen is chewy and good.
2. Tsukemen - RM30 - This is special, and had stronger taste. Ramen is much thicker and chewy than Bankara.
3. Chicken Nanban - RM21 - The nanban sauce is mix with mayo, egg and some salad. And the chicken although not hot, but crispy. The mixture of it is nice.
4. Almond Drink - RM11 - Their handmade honey almond drink, it is very dense and the almond taste will not too strong until you hardly accept it. The honey did neutralise the almond flavour.

Environment:
- Environment is good and comfortable.

Overall, it is good choice for ramen, just the price range is slightly at the high side. Recommend 👍🏼 | review_rating:4, text:Tried their recommended Kakuni Bankara, the broth base is shoyu, so expect a quite high level of saltiness. The pork belly has been cooking for so long, it just melts as soon as your chopsticks touch it. Not my kind of noodles, it's on the thicker side, but it grabs onto the broth very well. Just wished they given us the option to choose the level doneness of the noodles. The tsukemen is probably three times the salty level of the ramen, but it's good none the less. The option to add garlic tableside was great. Really elevates the flavour of the broth. | review_rating:4, text:Tried their tonkatsu broth and is flavorsome and thick. Although too salty for me, but will probably suit those who prefers strong flavors. The kakuni and chasiu is tender and juicy,  5 ⭐.

The ingredients use here is fresh. Had mine with peanuts, nata and coconut flakes. You'll definitely know if your nuts are not fresh.

The atmosphere is cozy and comfortable, with air conditioning making it a pleasant place to dine. However, do note that weekends can get busy, and you might need to queue.

As for the food, the polo bun is a standout—fresh and flavorful. The cheese rice is decent but has room for improvement. The croissant egg tart, while unique, was a bit too sweet for my taste, though others might enjoy it more.

Overall, it's worth a visit for the cozy ambiance and to try the signature items. | review_rating:2, text:Came in for lunch and we ordered the wanton soup noodle and the steamed pork patty with salted fish.

The difficulty levels and physical activity vary per room, and even though we chose the lower difficulty ones, they still tested our brainpower quite a bit! 😂 We managed to escape both rooms we attempted, which was a great accomplishment for us. You’re also allowed up to three clues from the staff, which definitely helped without giving too much away.

Speaking of the staff, Elisha and Ken were fantastic,both were super helpful and polite throughout. Whenever we got stuck, they provided just the right amount of micro clues, letting us figure things out without spoiling the puzzles. I really appreciated that. They were also knowledgeable and answered all our questions with ease.

1.    This was my first time dining at the restaurant.
2.	I was particularly impressed by the front counter staff member, Nicole, who provided an excellent introduction to the menu. Her friendly demeanor and warm smile made the experience welcoming, and she explained the menu thoroughly, understanding customers’ preferences and offering tailored recommendations. Her attentiveness and professionalism in promoting the dishes contributed to a positive first impression.
3.	Regarding the dining experience, there was one point of dissatisfaction with the garlic butter side dish. Although I ordered garlic butter, it arrived without any butter. I requested it a second time, but unfortunately, it was still served without butter. I also noticed a customer at a nearby table sharing similar feedback with the staff.
4.	When I mentioned this issue to Nicole, she was genuinely surprised and expressed her intention to relay the feedback to her supervisor. Her responsiveness and willingness to address the concern, despite it being a minor issue, were greatly appreciated.

Overall Impression: Aside from the missing butter, the overall dining experience was enjoyable, thanks largely to Nicole’s kindness and helpfulness. Her proactive approach to resolving the issue demonstrated her commitment to customer satisfaction. | review_rating:3, text:I was here 23/12/24 and i came here to eat at 2.22pm till around 4.15pm.

I got a pain au chocolat and a caramel latte for 9.50 and 16.00 respectively, totalling to 27.05 after tax, which is a little steep of a pricing to be honest, but its just a little more expensive than usual cafe prices nowadays, so its still acceptable.

the pain au chocolat was average, nothing extraordinary, it had nice layers and a fair amount of chocolate inside, but for the price, I personally wouldn’t get it again, but it’s not bad.
the caramel latte was actually quite enjoyable, it fit my tastes well, it’s somewhat sweet with good caramel flavour, but not overwhelmingly sweet, and the coffee flavour was present but more mellow than others i’d say, which is still quite nice. and their ice is really crunchy👍🧊

service was standard too, order and pay at counter, get a beeper thing, take a seat and wait until it beeps to go get your order.

overall not bad, would be back again to try different things.

Came to the store and requested the dress Im looking for. Went to fitting room and started changing.

The fitting room there were no doors only curtain that hang at the door frame to cover.
2 curtains from both sides per fitting room.

Was changing the dress halfway. The owner did not ask for my consent not inform me anything and just barged in and looked at me wearing the dress halfway. She asked ok or not after that and thought Ididnt know how to wear the dress correctly as ifs upside down/flippers over. I said ok then I said I can do it I'm wearing now. Then she left but the curtain was left opened about half.

Complaints:
Did not ask for my permission/consent before coming in.
Did not inform me verbally before coming in.
Did not have my INFORMED CONSENT before coming in.
Invasion of privacy (doesn't matter if they have their clothes on or not)
The cctv was angled outside the fitting room. This incident was RECORDED and there is a solid evidence. If there's none from the footage, I believe you have probably deleted it. But I have witnesses as well.

I've read your reviews and turns out I'm not the only victim that encounter this. You either apologize or might as well shut down the store. With that kind of behavior I don't think anyone would even come and help/support with your business.

I felt to traumatized and speechless during that incident because it was very random and unexpected and I was not even informed. I was so close to burst out in tears full of fear but I managed to handle it well.

So what if you're a female? Does that give you any rights for you to just barged in like that without my consent? You're not even my family member nor friends what gives you the right to treat your customers like that? Did no one teach you how to respect others privacy?

Please fix your behavior. I will not report you to the police but I will make sure others know about your behavior. Either you fix it now or you can start to prepare yourself in court.

Kwan Kee Store, a Michelin-recognized spot, is a must-visit for those who appreciate traditional Hong Kong pastries. Their dedication to authentic flavors and quality ingredients is evident in their offerings.

The white sugar sponge cake stands out with its light, fluffy texture and just the right level of sweetness—perfect for those who prefer a more delicate taste. The steamed red bean cake and pandan cake are also excellent, packed with red beans and maintaining a balanced, natural flavor without being overly sweet.

However, the Musang King rice roll falls a bit short. While the concept is interesting, it lacks the strong durian fragrance that one might expect from Musang King, leaving room for improvement in flavor intensity.

Price is on the high side, some might think worth it but some might not. | review_rating:4, text:I've tried a few items but I don't remember the names.

•	Family-Friendly Activities: The mall features an indoor ice-skating rink and a massive arcade that are perfect for kids and adults alike. My daughter loves to play at Parenthood. They have upgraded it too recently and we enjoyed it.
•	Food Haven: Offers an extensive selection of dining options from fast food to upscale restaurants. For Indian food you can try Mantra Restaurant (Not great but decent)

The condition is that the watch must be presented for the free battery replacement with the old battery regardless whether it leaking chemical or in any condition. Even if you have to remove the chemical leaking old battery, you must keep it for them.

I strongly suggest Swatch Malaysia amend their website to state this condition clearly and also train their staff to advise customers accordingly.

It's a large portion of noodles, which is usually a good thing for me but with this one it felt like it took forever to finish it because it just wasn't good.

It's possible the dish was left too long before it was served, because there was very little soup - maybe all soaked up by the noodles 🙈  Even my husband, who likes his noodles soft, didn't enjoy this.

The kimchi lava fried rice was also mediocre - the rice was mushy (my husband liked it that way tho), not enough flavour so this also had to be eaten with their soy sauce. The ""lava"" is just a runny egg omelette - you need to top up cheese to get the cheesey effect shown in the photos. At least we got a 20% discount for this dish though.

I called back to the shop and they said that they charged the price wrongly and ask us to go back to the shop immediately to get back our money. No compensation was given but causing more and more problems and inconvenience to customers. I’m not satisfied with the service so I’ve asked for a refund as I wanted to return the product back. This option is rejected and it shows how bad the service of this brand and how unprofessional this brand is as they did not train their employees well to prevent such things from happening. It also shows how bad the brand is as it’s after sales service is too bad. Besides, it’s already 2 weeks time and they have not processed the refund. | review_rating:5, text:Had a fabulous experience this morning. I stopped in looking for a wallet for my dad. There were two sales associates at the shop and both were super helpful and patient with me, especially the male associate who was helping me specifically (sorry didn’t catch your name!). I was trying to choose between two wallets with very different price points and they did not try to push me to the more expensive one. In fact the male associate actually pointed at the cheaper one saying the design of it would probably be more to the liking of an older gentleman. The display wallet was the last one so they couldn’t give me a new one, but polished the display one up for me, and also let me know that they offered lifetime polishing for the particular brand of wallet that I purchased, Charles Berkeley, my dad just needed to stop by any Leather Avenue outlet.

So I bought a logitech mouse for 300+ which sells between 250-300 on lazada. You have to understand that all shops here especially the tech shops in Asian Avenue will sell items at higher prices. This is because rent for pyramid is high. Those who give ratings such as *overprice* without a good reason - no comments.

I did NOT buy a laptop so I am not aware of the quality of service this place offers and so you have to take ur own risk when buying from here.

Pros: You can exchange faulty peripherals with other peripherals from other brands within 14 days of purchase if u are a member. (Rm300 purchase gives u free membership).

You also get 1 year warranty.

Cons: Slightly more expensive.

_________

My personal opinion: I try not to buy from lazada and stuff for electronic devices because they is no certification that it is original and it is very difficult to exchange or send ur device for warranty when u purchase it online. I would pay the extra RM 50 for the reassurance from this shop. (Peripherals ONLY)

But the service here is lackluster, like what most reviews have said. The cashier was a foriegn worker and I didn't know what he was mumbling.
Most tables are left dirty and not cleaned. The rubbish bin looks disgusting. | review_rating:1, text:I’ve always wanted to try Juicy ever since I started using Shopee e-vouchers. Today, I finally gave it a shot and ordered an Avocado drink since it was on sale for just RM8. While it was tasty and decent for the price, I don’t think it quite met the standard of a full-priced RM12.90 drink.

What really let me down, however, was the cashier’s attitude during my visit. As a first-timer at Juicy, I was hoping for a little guidance, but the female staff didn’t bother explaining the avocado drink options on the menu. Instead, she abruptly asked, “Avocado apa?” without pointing out the choices from the start. After I paid, she handed me the receipt without a word of thanks. Even though I said “thank you” to her, she didn’t smile or acknowledge it—her expression clearly showed she didn’t want to be there.

The lack of professionalism became even more apparent when the next customer (as seen in the photo) pointed out a mistake in their order. Rather than apologising and fixing the drink, the staff exchanged annoyed glances with each other. Based on this experience and previous Google reviews, it’s obvious that the staff could use serious training in customer service and might not be suited for Front-of-House roles in F&B. | review_rating:5, text:Have always love the juices here.

They were whispering when I approached. I am a frequent visitor at sunway pyramid but I realised that this only happens at your shop and I have noticed this multiple times prior to this occasion also. I understand everyone wants to finish  and close up to go back home but 9:20 it’s seems ridiculous. Even after my turn there were 3 more group of customers and the main cashier’s attitude was the same. What’s weird is that the cashier and the other worker seem to be giggling with each other but when serving customers they seemed like they just couldn’t care.

Worse think is what you saw, what you felt, what you paid for were not what they delivered
We bought the HIROMU SOFA set because of its COMFORT. What they delivered is just another ordinary SOFA Set. HARD AND NOT COMFORTABLE. THEY DONT HAVE CLOUD-LIKE COMFORT LIKE THE SHOWROOM UNIT.

We complained, they said they can't do much as their factory is in Ipoh (who care where is your factory as I'm buying from AKEMI).

We even asked them to exchange the SHOW ROOM UNIT with the new SOFA SET that they delivered but they said cannot.
We went to the store want them to send their staff to personally go to our house to ""feel"" the sofa delivered but they declined.
Finally they agreed to come over to check on the SOFA delivered but it is 2 weeks later i..e. SUNDAY 26JANUARY 2025. My goodness, is this AKEMI customer service?

This service is the worst service you can imagine, it's literally STEALING from customers! HOW can clients be charged so much for such poor service!
I asked for a basic manicure for 48RM, I was far from imagining that this only included nail trimming, no foot soaking, no cleaning, no filing of heels! absolutely nothing, just cut nails, file nails! when I asked the lady who did the pedicure if my feet should not be filed and if it was included in the pedicure, she told me yes but that my heels are hard, so she recommends the medical pedicure (88 RM) rather than the basic one! I thought it would be better, it was worse! She attacked the skin on my feet without wetting them or cleaning them, she just put a tiny bit of emollient product for the heels which she left on for less than 2 minutes, that's all, and she removed the calluses using a special blade. No scrub, no wash, no mask, no massage, no filing, in 15-20 minutes everything was finished and the cashier charged me for 2 pedicures! I paid for 136 RM for just cutting my nails, buffing them a little bit and cutting the callus wich is a scandal! It’s not about money, it’s a question of principles, and it was extremely disappointing!

The atmosphere as per exhibited by the waitress was bordeline hostile.

Question:

1. Is it the SOP that takeaway customers are not allowed to be seated in order to view the menu & make the selection?

The restaurant was only a handful of customers since it was after lunch hour (1521 hours). Thus, there are a lot of empty tables. In addition, there were no customer queuing anyway.

2. Is it the SOP that takeaway customers is warranted to wait outside of the restaurant while awaiting for the meal to be ready?

It really baffles me that I was not allowed to be seated because I have chose to takeway my meals.

The waitress in a way insisted me to wait outside for my meal, whereas, I have ordered 2 drinks for dine-in (the drinks were noted as takeaway in the receipt, even though I have stated otherwise).

If not because of one (1) of the waiter (a gentleman), I would have to stand outside while waiting for my meal.

3. Is it the SOP as well for the customer to clear the table from the drinks which were consumed as dine-in?
(As aforementioned, the drinks were packed as takeaway, whereas I had it ordered as dine-in).

The variety of vegetable dishes offered a good mix of textures and flavors, from creamy dhal to tangy pickles and spiced stir-fried vegetables. Each component complemented the others, creating a well-balanced and wholesome dining experience.

The Iced Lemon Tea was a welcome addition, providing a refreshing contrast to the warm, spice-laden dishes. While not overly sweet, it had just the right amount of tartness to cleanse the palate between bites.

Service was efficient and friendly, with the staff ensuring our needs were met without being intrusive. Given the reasonable pricing and generous portions, the meal felt like great value for money. | review_rating:5, text:It is such a wonderful dining experience. The two waiters are patiently waiting for our order. We ordered vegetarian thali set that comes with a serving of naan. The side dishes are so nice, the naan is crispy and fresh. We had paneer with black dhal and tomato, which is excellent! What a great choice. We added another serving of Kashmiri Pulao rice, and it is so good. The cashew nuts are crunchy and fresh and added such flavour to the rice. We had maggo lassi to finish. What a wonderful dining experience. Highly recommended. | review_rating:5, text:Best Indian food in this side of KL. I was on long stay at the sunway pyramid hotel and a regular visitor here, whenever I get a craving for Home food taste.
Amazing Serving experience, even the samosa is served with fresh salad and ketchup.
All their food items are prepared very well and reasonably quick. The prices are slightly on the higher side, but totally acceptable considering this shop is inside a Mall.
The ambience is excellent as well!
I highly recommend everyone to go here. | review_rating:5, text:I ordered the chicken biryani, but it was just okay, with the rice portion being disappointingly small. The naan was overly crispy, almost like a papad, which was not what I expected. The paneer masala was merely satisfactory, lacking the flavor I was hoping for. On the positive side, the ambiance was pleasant and enjoyable, creating a nice dining environment. Overall, the food didn’t quite live up to expectations, but the setting made it a decent experience. | review_rating:3, text:Looks like a potentially great place but other than the authentic decor and playing, the food really disappointed.

Services were good. Staff were friendly and attentive. | review_rating:4, text:We ordered 3 main dishes and 4 drinks. The quality, presentation and portion of the food is pretty good.

Our mix platter were generally okay. My son love the yogurt sauce and I think he complimented it at least 10 times. Lol. The lamb meat is a little on the tough, chewier side. The kebab is also a little dense. Chicken breast cutlets a little overcooked. Hummus needs more olive oil & I would prefer if you don't spread it so thinly on the plate. By the time it is served it almost dried out. Probably just spread on certain portion of the plate and keep it thicker.

The beef burger (served using a pita bread) is good. My only comment is the sauce used in it taste a little like cheap cheese sauce. Otherwise, the nachos, salad are good. The meat inside is flavorful but still also on the dense side. I think maybe is the same meat mixture as the kebab.

The buffalo wings batter is really crispy. The fries are done so well. Super crispy and well seasoned.

The drinks were all great in taste and presentation.

We love the atmosphere and the service attitude. ♥️ | review_rating:4, text:Good menu variety, very unique fusion of modern mediterranean food. Place is comfortable and bright, and service is good. Loved the nachos and especially that dipping sauce that came with it.
Ordered the falafel wrap because it seemed pretty unique. Taste was great but somehow it didn't sit well with my stomach later on.
We got the free baklava set from signing up and honestly it was not too sweet and just nice.

It was my first time trying Lebanese coffee. The coffee wasn’t too strong and suited my taste. It also had a hint of cardamom and a slightly spiced flavor.

All the staff were very kind and customer-friendly. The prices of the food were quite reasonable and not too expensive. Worth it. However, the downside is that the internet at the shop was a bit weak, so ordering online was a bit slow and challenging. Hopefully, the management will take note of this.

They were having a 20% discount offer for their hot food offerings when I visited.

I ordered the chicken pie that came with a side of brown gravy and mashed potato. The pie crust was okay although I wished it was a little lighter and fluffier. It was also not as warm as I would have preferred it. Nonetheless, the filling was flavorful with a mix of chicken and mushroom. For the price however, they could have given more pieces of chicken.

Service was relatively fast although there were only 2 occupied tables. Seating was comfortable and the decor had a nicer minimalist look that I appreciate. | review_rating:4, text:I popped into Pineyard at Sunway Pyramid with my mum recently, hoping to find a cosy spot for brunch. We decided on the grilled sourdough sandwich first; it was nicely buttered and crisp on the outside but turned out rather hard and chewy. The filling of mushrooms, spinach, and cheese had a lovely flavour, albeit a bit on the oily side.

The carbonara was rich, creamy, and made even more indulgent by a runny poached egg. The deep-fried chicken ham added a satisfying crunch and extra savouriness. We also had an iced gula melaka and an orange juice—both decent choices.

Price-wise, Pineyard leans slightly towards the higher end, but I must say the service was prompt and friendly. | review_rating:5, text:I had their carbonara for dinner and it was so good, I really love it. I also bought their pasties and they're really soft even if you eat it the next day.

My sister and I just recently purchased innerwear from here (22/4/2023) and the employees there are quite alright, I manage to find my size but my sister took some time in finding it, which she later noticed its not the right size for her on that day when we got back home.

I understand its her incompetence when it comes to choosing something you wear everyday and still able to choose wrong. So we went back to the store for an exchange (24/4/2023) and it's a different staff this time. Though I find this employee to be somewhat irritated due to her tone when she's serving. But the biggest problem was that she secretly CUT OFF the price tag after my sister had finally done choosing the right size WITHOUT informing us and for me, that just leaves a sour taste in my mouth.

I believe staff have to at least inform the customers that they will cut off the price tag due to whatever reasons presents. Either its because customers can only exchange product once or any other reason at all, for the staff to cut off the price tag like that is just another stamp approval of me not visiting this store anymore.

That’s just natural given how popular and the reputation it has among the locals like myself. I only visited their branch in KLIA but not the one here.

So when my family arrived at this branch this morning, there was a pretty long cue. But what I admire most was how quick their staff got their act together in ensuring each waiting customer gets welcome and directed to their seats while not getting them to wait too long. I personally thought their service was pretty professional and efficient.

Their environment was pretty spot on as it gives off the classy kopitiam vibes.

Now, when it comes to their food & beverages. Their coffee is certainly not bad but is definitely not the best I’ve tried. Their famous Ipoh Hor Fun was rather bland and am not too sure why it’s much to shout about. I certainly have tried much better Ipoh Hor Fun out there. But don’t let that ruin your entire experience at this restaurant. The saving grace for me and is one of their must try dishes if you’re here is their Nasi Lemak and their Kaya & Butter Toast bun as well as their Oriental Polo Bun. Am glad that it wasn’t a completely letdown and negative experience.

It’s definitely a good place to have breakfast or tea time.

Instead, it maintained a satisfying crunchiness, which is how I prefer my okra to be prepared.

The kimchi ramen was decent overall, though I didn't particularly enjoy some of the ingredients, such as the bean sprouts and cabbage. Personal preferences aside, I appreciated the opportunity to find a suitable vegetarian restaurant option within the Sunway Pyramid mall.

Overall, I'm glad I was able to discover this Japanese vegetarian restaurant, as it provided a refreshing change of pace from the more common Chinese vegetarian offerings in the area. It's always encouraging to see a diverse array of meatless dining options becoming available. | review_rating:5, text:Wonderful Japanese food for vegetarians!

Quoting what that gentleman says ""upgrading a lps for a DC in product makes no sense, as it's not 240V AC in type"" you can't compare.

You are feeling a bit lost here? No worries, I believe he has no idea what he is talking about, they even bash their own product and having the mindset of expensive stuff must always be better. I believe a salesman who works in Hi-end HiFi shop should have the basic knowledge, having someone shytting on the brand they carry just because it's cheaper, and the fact that he doesn't appreciate the difference a good power supply can do in a system even for a DC in product, I don't think that guy is qualified for the job.

Furthermore, the guy is being very impatient and kinda rude, you will get a feeling of they don't want to serve you if you don't bring a stack of cash and put it on the counter to show them you are a serious buyer. Definitely would not buy from such guy even if I like the system.

As someone who has bought from other CMY branch, I feel disappointed with such service was provided.

There are more to add, when I try to test him out if he knows what he is selling. the product definitely said ""analog volume"", which switches between relays for the volumes control. When I bring up this topic, he is very sure that it's a false claim from the manufacturer, he claims that all manufacturers claim so, but it's a chip base digital gain volume control. So I would appreciate that if the salesman learn more about the product they are selling, if you are unsure, don't act like you know all of them.

Tried the Coconut Mango Boom, and it was truly a decent drink! The combination of coconut and mango was refreshing, making it a perfect choice for a warm day. What really stood out to me was the ability to customize the sugar level, which is a thoughtful touch. It’s great to have the option to adjust sweetness according to personal preference; this kind of flexibility is often hard to find in many bubble tea shops.

As for the pricing, I found it quite reasonable for the quality of the drinks. | review_rating:1, text:I already order with this girl two time!

I opted for the spicy mala bowl, and it did not disappoint! The flavors were rich and robust, with just the right amount of heat to keep things exciting. I chose the beef bowl, and the beef slices were thin, delicious, and generously portioned with lots of fresh ingredients. I heard it’s specially made for mala lovers, and I really loved it.

One of the highlights was the Osmanthus Ice Jelly – a must-try! The unique taste of this cool drink was both refreshing and tasty, making it a perfect complement to the hotpot.

Additionally, I would highly recommend the Australian Beef Slice, Pork Slice, and Lamb Slice. All the meat slices were incredibly fresh and enhanced the overall dining experience.

I recently visited this restaurant after being drawn in by a 50% discount promotion. Unfortunately, the experience left me feeling underwhelmed and questioning the value for money. Here’s a breakdown of my visit:

Atmosphere ★★★★☆ (4/5)
The restaurant has a cozy and inviting vibe with wooden tables and tasteful decorations. Since it’s located inside a mall, the air conditioning keeps the space comfortable, making it a pleasant spot to sit and relax. However, the ambiance didn’t quite make up for the other shortcomings.

Service ★★★☆☆ (3/5)
The ordering process is straightforward—you place your order at the counter, and the staff delivers it to your table. While the staff was polite, it took about 10 minutes for our food to arrive, which is reasonable but not particularly fast. The service was average, with no standout moments of hospitality.

Food ★★☆☆☆ (2/5)
The food was disappointing overall. The portions were noticeably smaller than advertised, and the quality didn’t justify the price.
•	Chicken Katsu Cromburger ★★☆☆☆ (2/5):
The burger looked promising at first glance, with fresh and soft bread. However, the chicken was tough and difficult to chew, which ruined the dish. I added scrambled eggs and vegetables for an extra RM8, but they were bland and didn’t add much flavor.
•	Chicken Pepperoni Croissant ★★★☆☆ (3/5):
This dish fared slightly better than the cromburger. The croissant was flaky and buttery, but the chicken pepperoni filling lacked seasoning and excitement. It was edible but not memorable.
The overall taste of the dishes felt uninspired, with no standout flavors or attention to detail in preparation.

Price ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5)
This is where things went downhill fast. The 50% discount promotion was misleading—it only applied if you ordered an overpriced drink. I ended up ordering a Bloody Mocha with Cheese for nearly RM17, which was overly sweet and gimmicky. With additional charges like RM8 for scrambled eggs, my total bill for two people came to almost RM78 after taxes. For this price, I expected much higher quality food and larger portions.

Parking - N/A
Since this restaurant is located inside a mall, parking depends entirely on the mall’s facilities. It wasn’t an issue during my visit, but this will vary based on location and time of day.

Final Verdict: Not Worth Revisiting
With its tricky marketing tactics, overpriced menu items, and below-average food quality, I won’t be returning to this restaurant anytime soon. While the atmosphere was pleasant enough, it doesn’t make up for the lackluster dining experience or poor value for money. If you’re looking for better options in this price range, there are plenty of other restaurants that offer superior quality at a fairer price.
Ideal Times to Visit: If you’re still curious about trying this place despite its flaws, visiting during off-peak hours might ensure faster service and a quieter atmosphere.

We also ordered some side dishes. | review_rating:3, text:Value meals are among my more affordable food in the mall. Ordered Hakka noodles which texture and taste was somewhat lacking in that traditional chewiness, aroma and taste of a good old bowl of traditional hakka noodles. Then fried wanton was a little bland. Prefer Tang Ping restaurant in SS2.
Ordering process thru the phone including payment was clinical and somewhat impersonal and distant. Slight mistake in the delivery of the drink and similar mistake observed in other customer order. Both the food, environment and service fail to draw me back there again. | review_rating:5, text:Nice atmosphere👍👍. Great view! Located at the top floor food street. Unlike some other branches, This Yi Poh branch is consistently serving quality dishes👍👍. Serving is by robots, waiting time not too long. Good crowds during weekends.

It doesn't taste like Curry Mee and doesn't look like Curry Mee. It looks like Hokkien Prawn mee Soup.. but taste not even near it. No coconut milk at all!

This was the worst Curry Mee i had ever tasted and experience in YiPoh Sunway.

The branch isn't really big, but it's cosy enough to have a sit down and have a nice chat. Recommended.

When you're faced with competition from the other bigger chain specs stores, the only way to stand out is with customer service. And both Nelson and Izzah excel from start to finish.

During an initial visit, I tried on many different pairs and was attended to by Nelson, who politely and calmly helped me with my choices. But, I didn't get anything, thinking that I should look around first.

However, I didn't receive the same treatment elsewhere, even though I found something I really liked. And because of that, I went back to Oopa to get two pairs because of the service level.

The range that they have here may not be as much as others, but you feel really satisfied spending your money here for the service and care that's shown as a customer - and that's priceless.

The service is also excellent as servers are constantly nearby. They cook for you as well, and they do a good job at it, too. This particular branch is really nice as it's the most spacious I've seen. They also have a nice kids' room attached to the restaurant.

Definitely and highly recommended! | review_rating:5, text:Had a great meal here! There were three of us, and we went for their set for two—it was just the right amount. Also got the vegetable pancake, which was super crispy and delicious!

The staff were friendly and attentive, and the biggest win? We walked out not smelling like oil or smoky bbq. You know that scent that usually clings to your clothes after Korean BBQ? None of that here!

The interior design is nice and comfy, the staffs are friendly and helpful. It’s a cozy place for gathering and dine in. The is a playroom available for kid 3-12 years old too!

The taste of food is average according to my own preference. The menu did mention about the weight of the pork slice for 2 pax but personally think it’s small portion 😅 I definitely pork lover hence the portion is small for me.

Yummy yoghurt ice cream and it’s free flow, so with the bancan!

Overall happy with the dine in experience!

Very uncomparation with other BBQ and hot pot restaurant perfect matching 2 in 1 set , affordable price and enjoying unlimited free desert ice cream with quality yoghurt ice cream free flow.. The pity of staff restaurant keeps refilling until the machine needs time to freeze ice cream. But lucky with display-hanging
""Notice preparation on progress."" Good practise every 5-7minutes. I still can enjoy the ice cream!

I also never expected free-flow side dishes/vegetables in here , Normally, we ask only to provide as normal restaurants practise.

Good to gain memory. At least, this is my future place for dine perfect combination. Never try, Never know.

Impressive in detailing informing customers service from time being, Even busy weekend still manageable but still feel provide services.

No choice. I've to become a regular guest here as a service provider, and alertness attention from the manager meets up my expectations.

As Mention enjoy peacefully, play room is temptation for me.. hehe.

Food is quite affordable price and has more choices for me in different varieties of BBQ, even Ala Carte.  Good space and large table suitable for family gatherings, so far this  place is the most plenty big table. But lucky do a reservation early.

The green tea is particularly impressive, flavorful, and worth the price. Although the spaghetti is on the pricier side, it’s worth it, with fresh prawns cooked perfectly.

We ordered tea and dessert, which tastes really good and reasonable to the pricing. However, management needs to put in the time to train their employees to elevate the place.

I looked at the menu and saw so many different types of teas. This is for people who are willing to pay the money to try out nuances between different types of teas.
The place presents itself as a more sophisticated place, not just your regular cafe. So, I asked the waitress for recommendations.

To my disappointment, the waitresses there were clearly part-timers hired to only serve tables. They also didn't have a person dedicated to recommend teas or talk about why is it brewed a certain way.

This should have been the selling point of the place-- yet it is not fully utilized.

From this experience, it goes from a potential spot for tea lovers who want to try different types of teas-- to suddenly just a regular cafe.

To be honest, the staff were polite, I find no fault in the service itself. I just can tell that no further training was given for them -- or 1 dedicated person -- to make the experience better. Again, I wouldn't write this much if it's just a regular cafe.

I can see that there is potential, and I can tell what the initial vision was.  I hope to see the place improve over time, or, to accept the route of being a regular cafe, where customers will start to ask about the price versus what you're getting. Just food for thought! | review_rating:3, text:The price vs environment doesn't match. It is a tad pricey for the food portion and serving doesn't come together if you come in group.

What makes this worse is that they don’t even have a service center to handle issues directly. It’s all just a frustrating online back-and-forth with no actual support.

Aeroline Penang—Corus Hotel KL

Trip started PROMPTLY at 8:30 AM, no delays. Driver and crew, Faiz was very nice. They helped with check in, seat directory and baggage. The driver was very skilful when navigating through the narrow roads. In one instance, it was a 2 lane road and there was one car illegally parked.  The driver still managed to drive by without even needing to reverse.

At around 8:35, Faiz came down the row with comfy blue blankets and headphones.  The headphones worked great with the on-board entertainment (OBE). The OBE was equipped with many movies and songs, of different genres.

At about 9, Faiz served food to us. It had spicy rice, potato wedges and egg. The food was 9/10, tasty! He also served hot drinks which also tasted great!

The rest of the trip, he went around a few times to collect trash.

There was one stop at a fuel station for 15 MINUTES break.

At about 1PM-1:30PM, we arrived at Corus Hotel. Driver was nice enough to let me take videos of the bus.

2 mineral water bottles with Aeroline branding is provided.

Overall, awesome ride. It deserves more than 5 stars!

•	Diverse Shopping: With a wide array of shops, it caters to all family members, from fashion to gadgets.
•	Family-Friendly Activities: The mall features an indoor ice-skating rink and a massive arcade that are perfect for kids and adults alike. My daughter loves to play at Parenthood. They have upgraded it too recently and we enjoyed it.
•	Food Haven: Offers an extensive selection of dining options from fast food to upscale restaurants. For Indian food you can try Mantra Restaurant (Not great but decent)

The portions were more than satisfying, ensuring a fulfilling meal.

The Iced Lemon Tea was a welcome addition, providing a refreshing contrast to the warm, spice-laden dishes. While not overly sweet, it had just the right amount of tartness to cleanse the palate between bites.

Worse think is what you saw, what you felt, what you paid for were not what they delivered
We bought the HIROMU SOFA set because of its COMFORT. What they delivered is just another ordinary SOFA Set. HARD AND NOT COMFORTABLE. THEY DONT HAVE CLOUD-LIKE COMFORT LIKE THE SHOWROOM UNIT.

We complained, they said they can't do much as their factory is in Ipoh (who care where is your factory as I'm buying from AKEMI).

We even asked them to exchange the SHOW ROOM UNIT with the new SOFA SET that they delivered but they said cannot.
We went to the store want them to send their staff to personally go to our house to ""feel"" the sofa delivered but they declined.
Finally they agreed to come over to check on the SOFA delivered but it is 2 weeks later i..e. SUNDAY 26JANUARY 2025. My goodness, is this AKEMI customer service? I personal feeling is that they will not turn up citing CNY, TOO BUSY! | review_rating:1, text:Buying bed sheet sets , surprise to find out that I need to pay RM5 for a bag ??!!

Not only Anne give a good haircut, she attentive and provides a good chat. Anne also recommend treatment for my hair, which after a few days my hair really did felt better and much stronger. I’ve also bought a product recommended by her, it does help. Overall a great experience. | review_rating:1, text:I went to APT for a hair wash and normal dry. I went here because I've been to APT Salon several times when I lived in Penang and the service and quality there was good. And even prices were very reasonable.
Over here, in Sunway Pyramid, they charged me 60+ RM for my thin hair. I was still okay to pay because I wanted good service.
The person who washed my hair couldn't understand a word of English. He took me directly to the hair wash basin for the wash, unlike how it used to be done at the Penang branch. Before starting I asked him to shampoo only once as my hair tends to get too dry with double shampooing. But he went ahead and shampooed twice anyway.
Then when he was applying conditioner I requested that he leave it on for a couple of minutes so it can actually condition my hair and he said ok, but washed it off in less than 15 seconds. 🤷‍♀️
Then, while blowdrying he used the high heat blast from the very beginning and kept bringing it very close to my scalp. And he kept focussing on the back of my scalp while the front was just airdrying and setting to become kind-of messy-frizzy..
After he was done I had to ask him to apply hair serum, and That's something that he should have done without me asking considering how sadly he had blow-dried my hair.
After the wash my scalp has been completely damaged. It's been almost 3 weeks now since this hair wash and my scalp has not recovered yet. The back portion of my scalp is still soar and extremely itchy and i usually never have an itchy scalp. I've never faced this issue ever before. I'm not sure if it's bad products used or bad technique or both together, but it's ruined my scalp. All I wanted was a relaxing hair wash. But instead left disappointed with a damaged scalp.
One thing salon Staff should understand is that everyone coming there has different hair types and should be handled according to that. ONE METHOD/FORMULA DOESN'T FIT ALL when it comes to hair. Especially in Malaysia where you find a mix of people from so many ethnicities it's expected all the more.
Anyway all in all, bad service and disappointing experience.

However, as we were about to make our purchase, another staff member told us that the prices on the shoes were fixed, and the discount was only 15% if we signed up for a membership. This significant discrepancy in pricing led us to leave without questioning them further. To add to our frustration, when I mentioned our expectation of a 31% discount, a female staff member wearing a tudung rolled her eyes and began discussing us as we exited the store.

They don't even have the full range of products to view. I went there to look for the Deluxe Latex Contour pillow and was told they don't have that.

Burger had sufficient crust and the meatiness came thru. I appreciate a burger that’s more about the meat and cheese and less about the sauce it’s drowned in. Was better than the one in TRX.

Fries were fresh, crispy and well salted but I’m not a fan of crinkle cut. The 50-50 had a strong lemony taste with a hint of tea. Not too sweet.

Overall not too bad, though go into it like you’re getting a burger at a sit down restaurant, not fast food as the prices are definitely not cheap. | review_rating:2, text:Honestly expected a lot from a burger for this price range I mean its not five guys lol.

Taste was average or should I say no taste at all ? Loads of meat does NOT equal to good food.

Exorbitant price for the burger and it comes on its own ? Bro are you serious no sides I mean at least should mention that on the menu so that we can order the sides together.

Well tried both the normal fries and cheese fries both were below average.

Nothing in particular that stands out except the hype.

In short doesn’t taste like what it looks like. | review_rating:5, text:Located at the entrance of Sunway Pyramid. This is the second Shake Shack American burger restaurant in town (1st outlet at TRX).

The burgers here looks small in size but really packs a punch! Their signature smoky flavours makes it quite hard to stop eating as soon as you take the first bite. Go for their hot favourite  ""Double Shack"" burger and addictive crinkled cut fries. Hot dog is on the menu too.

Wonderful experience with each and every bite! Definitely worth returning. | review_rating:3, text:Not the best, but certainly not the worst burger joint either. Would say that I'd rate Shake Shack a little higher if the prices wasn't so outrageous.
I ordered the Avocado strraky beef burger. Taste-wise, I do l like their burger buns, but the burger itself was lacking any smokeyness or flavor. The ice cream, was just like any other ice cream. And lastly the Malaysia-exclusive Bunga Raya Shake, which was way too sweet too the point that I couldn't finish it.
But other than that, service was great, and the whole place had a nice vibe to it. | review_rating:2, text:I wouldn’t say the best burger in town. I only love the fact the crispy beef streak was good and the burger is juicy and not greasy. The hotdog was hard and dry. I can’t say I like the shake, too sweet and not thick enough. I didn’t taste the malt. The fries is a big disappointment - just a normal frozen store bought crinkle cut fries and comes with the broken small bits. With that price, should be a fresh thick cut real potatoes.",4.5,N/A,"Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Tuesday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Wednesday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Thursday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Friday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Saturday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Sunday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM"

So many nice figure, and so cozy.. the food itself is nice and soft (Croissant) and the price is affordable for the drink is 67% cocoa is great taste just the glass is quite small for cold.. maybe the glass can be big a bit cause the hot drink and the cold drink is small big... ridiculous..

The staff service is okay.. maybe can be upgrade.  When there is no customer, they are free but then suddenly there a few customer they cant coop with it.. so whats the S.O.P.. do send your drink and food to customer or do we need to take by ourself.. cause some they send and some take by theirself.. so whats your end said?

Taste wise, biting into either their fried chicken or beef burgers is quite nostalgic if you have had their offerings from childhood. It still tastes pretty decent and some of the menu options on display do reflect the pinoy influence on the menu options here. All in all, a decent alternative to the competition at the Golden Arches and other similar outlets. Oh, and they have Mountain Dew. Recommended if you've never tried this or used to enjoy their offerings as a kid. | review_rating:5, text:First time tried Jollibees. Love it. Fried chickens taste different from others franchise. Like the sweetness of the spaghetti (suit for my kid). Kinda fond with pineapple juice to cleanse the taste after the meal. Mashed potatoes not too soft and the gravy not thick which I preferred thick. Coleslaw fresh and sweet. Unfortunately service kinda slow. | review_rating:2, text:This isn't my first visit here, but my most recent visit left me dissappointed with the food. I ordered the Burger steak thay comes with a rice and a burger patty. Needless to say, check out my photo to see how depressing that burger patty looks. I had to hold it up with a fork to take this photo or else its so thin that it sinks beneath the sauce. The taste was ok, but portion was really not worth the money.
The only saving grace was the peach mango pie which has been my all-time favourite.
Will I be back? Maybe, but I would go for the Jolly spaghetti or chicken next time. | review_rating:4, text:My first time trying Jollibee yesterday. I ordered a set which had 1 piece of chicken, a burger, spagetti and a drink. And I added an ala carte hotdog so that I get to try a wide range of their food.
The burger was relatively small in size but the taste of the burger meat was pretty nice, compared to other fast food burgers. It had a pleasant distinct smoky flavour.
Am happy they had spagetti because I love spagetti.
The special thing about their fried chicken was their brown sauce which had herb taste in it. And the chicken seasoning was nice too.
The sausage in the hot dog tasted good too - it had a unique smoky taste to it too. The BBQ sauce was a tad too sweet and overpowering.
A bit disappointed their drink was not re-fillable.

A shout out to the sweet server staff who help bring the whole lot of food to my table instead having me go collect to food fm the counter myself. | review_rating:2, text:It is very disappointing that rice and chicken together only got very small portion of gravy, cannot add on extra gravy also, the cleanliness of the seat also quite bad, need to self service to clean up the table and eat.

They provide various options on top of beef selections; including a variety of pork meat, meatballs, vegetables, noodles and rice, desserts and drinks. All meat selections are delicious and you can tell that they are good quality. I love beef brisket, it just melted in my mouth. So many choices to choose from~ You can even choose two soup flavours! I spent a good two hours there and I was content when I walked out.
They have a free sign-up lifetime membership for points, a discount on birthday month, etc. It is a great deal. Do inquire about that further with the staff there.

Had the plain sugar donut, so light just like eating baked flour. I don't think it's anything special given everyone can do donuts these days.
The toasted sourdough sandwiches are pretty decent for the price. Only thing was given only 30% occupied still takes a while to toast. Can't imagine what happens on a packed lunch time.
Also customer service at the tables were poor most tables have cutlery, plates lying around and are unwiped.

Furthermore there is a bus area whereby there is some kitchen toys and soft blocks available for play but the condition is very bad, the soft blocks has been chew off and there isn’t much kitchen utensils to play with, only an empty kitchen counter there. Worst still there are many uncovered electric plug points there whereby toddlers will be able to touch it freely, the electric plug point shouldn’t be built there or at least it must be covered up with child protection measures. My young daughter went to play with the switch and i have to constantly tell her not to touch it! This is unacceptable as this is a children playground.

The staff at The Parenthood were super friendly and helpful, making sure everything ran smoothly. They took care of all our needs, from setup to ensuring the kids were safe and having fun.

The birthday party packages were fantastic too, offering a wide selection of entertainment options, delicious food, and even personalized touches to make the day special. We couldn’t have asked for a better place to celebrate this milestone.

Entry was swift. Staff are helpful and accommodating. Siligent on cleaning even on a non busy day. It has different play sections, which is good, so older kids will not hurt by accident the younger ones. There are lots of slides, which is fun even for small built adults.

The entrance fee is very reasonable for a whole day play.  About 30 ringgit on weekday / 60 ringgit on weekend, public and school holiday.
Re entry is allowed as long as within that day and with a guardian or parent going in together. Extra guardian or parent is charged 5 ringgit.

Socks is needed to enter like most playgrounds. They charge a reasonable 7 ringgit in case you need it.

There's also a cafe inside where parents could rest while waiting. Opposite the playground is a  shop for kids stuff.

Overall, it's worth it to try. | review_rating:3, text:A beautifully designed play area for children, with the London bus outside being the most attractive feature! It’s a fun place for kids to explore and enjoy.

However, I felt a little disappointed as the playground space is smaller than last year, and the horse carousel ride is no longer there. The area feels shorter than before, which affects the overall play experience.

One major concern is safety—the staff should keep an eye on kids playing rough, especially on the big slide. Since children of all ages play together, some older kids don’t follow the play rules, making it scary for kids under 7 to enjoy themselves.

Hope the management can improve the playground space and safety monitoring in the future!",4.2,+60 16-210 4398,"Monday: 10:00 AM – 9:30 PM, Tuesday: 10:00 AM – 9:30 PM, Wednesday: 10:00 AM – 9:30 PM, Thursday: 10:00 AM – 9:30 PM, Friday: 10:00 AM – 9:30 PM, Saturday: 10:00 AM – 9:30 PM, Sunday: 10:00 AM – 9:30 PM"

Also, the photos showed whole blueberries and bigger strawberry pieces on the waffles, but you only get them in halves.

Now for the food... What can I say. It was really yummy with the lamb stewed to falling of the bone and the chicken was fork tender. The mix platter kebabs was scrumptious as well with just a minor misharmony with the chicken kebab being a tad dry in this symphony of good food vibes.

The only complaint will be the price point. Is getting way more expensive compared to other fruit beverage maker.

We ordered the healthy drink Power size with #myDigi app promotion. The staff poured the drink to the Power size cup and it wasn't full so she added a cup of ice and blended again to pour it into the cup to make it full. We drank it and it was too bland and tasteless. We nicely feedback to the staffs and the replies we got was it's bland because it's health drink without yogurt in it and both the staffs keep insisting that's the reason the juice got bland. We then told them that they have added so much ice into it and they kept insisting they only add in half cup of ice which we saw there are a total of 2 full cup of ice (before blended the first round and 2nd round another cup). They didn't want to take responsibility for it and just simply give reasons to shoo us away instead of helping the paying customers. We then went to the cashier to tell the cashier thinking she might be the person who could at least solve the problem but she just acted blur and turned away. The staffs also asked us to move away and not blocking the cashier for other customers to make payment which then there were no customers behind us. This is SUPER RUDE. One of the staff then get our drink and then asked to pour away the ice but it was blended and we wonder how she would do that to pour away the ice? We saw her just pour the drink out to the blender and pour some juice away into the sink then pour back into the cup. And guess what the content becomes even lesser and the TASTE IS STILL BLAND. The staffs are trying to CHEAT on customers CONSTANTLY. We were so tired of their NONSENSE. At last the staff took the drink back and pour back into the blender and add one tiny piece of pineapple to add abit of taste to blend. It had a bit of taste but still the TASTE IS OFF. We were so TIRED OF talking to them anymore which lead to deaf ears so we just walked away with the healthy drink that just taste like WATER.

It's colorful and pretty looking. That's what gets me all the time. What's more, it's Manuka Honey and not the pure sugar that is making it sweet.

But the drinks do suit my taste buds. | review_rating:5, text:As a fan of health-conscious beverages, I recently tried Manuka honey drink, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations in both taste and nutritional benefits.

Firstly, let's talk about the flavor. Manuka honey drink offers a delightful blend of sweetness from the honey with a subtle hint of earthiness. The richness of the honey provides a comforting warmth to each sip, making it a truly enjoyable experience.

Beyond its taste, the health benefits of Manuka honey are well-documented. Renowned for its antibacterial properties, Manuka honey is believed to support immune health and promote overall well-being. Knowing that each sip of this delicious beverage may contribute to my health gives me even more reason to indulge.

What I appreciate most about Manuka honey drink is its versatility. Whether enjoyed hot as a soothing beverage on a chilly day or chilled for a refreshing pick-me-up, it never fails to satisfy my cravings for something both healthy and delicious.

In conclusion, Manuka honey drink has earned its place as a staple in my beverage repertoire. Its delectable flavor and potential health benefits make it a standout choice for anyone looking to elevate their drinking experience. I highly recommend giving it a try – your taste buds and your body will thank you. | review_rating:5, text:Just nice packing and very gentle staff.

From the place I sat I could see the kitchen staff were eating in the kitchen. While another few were standing stay far away from their customers without checking nor having eye contact with the customers. Unfortunately, the table I saw at without the bell.

The herbal noodle soup I ordered is bland and over price. I requested for soya sauce, when delivered that time there is oil inside, make me wonder if the sauce plate unclean or it's recycle. At the end I did not consume.

Definitely will not go back again. Food over price with not meeting expectations quality and services. | review_rating:5, text:If you are new to this restaurant, you might consider to try out their signature noodles. I personally don’t feel the noodle has much different with the other branches.

•	Food Haven: Offers an extensive selection of dining options from fast food to upscale restaurants. For Indian food you can try Mantra Restaurant (Not great but decent)
•	Convenient Layout: Despite its size, the mall is well-organized, making navigation easy.
•	Themed Decor: The Egyptian-inspired architecture adds a unique charm, making every visit memorable.

It was full of different types of goods ranging from cosmetics, household, clothes, kitchen utensils n cutlery,stationery to even food n beverage. You name it n you can find almost anything here. No wonder so many people like to shop here. The prices are really reasonable n most items are usually priced at only RM 5.90 only. Except for other bigger n more expensive items- these come with a higher price. You can shop at your own leisure without any sales person breathing down your neck.

This store is popular among young people, student, foreigner & tourist, especially female. Even though, the Japanese Yen had been down to the Forex rate of 3.0 but the price is never down but keep on increasing.

I went to the G floor branch (next to Parkson).

The first time I went to counter 1 to change A currency, I said I wanted to split two receipts, he said he couldn’t split the transaction and asked me to queue up again.

OK, Second time I went to counter 1 again (only 1 counter is open) and changed A currency.

Seeing that there was no one in line behind me, I said I wanted to change B currency, he said no, he could only change money from one country per person at a time, which means I had to wait until someone came to queue up to change money before I could change money for the third time?

Meanwhile counter 2 is open, then I pointed to counter 2 and asked if I could change money, counter 1 said NO, because counter 2 is new and he didn’t know how to do it.

•	Diverse Shopping: With a wide array of shops, it caters to all family members, from fashion to gadgets.
•	Family-Friendly Activities: The mall features an indoor ice-skating rink and a massive arcade that are perfect for kids and adults alike. My daughter loves to play at Parenthood. They have upgraded it too recently and we enjoyed it.
•	Food Haven: Offers an extensive selection of dining options from fast food to upscale restaurants. For Indian food you can try Mantra Restaurant (Not great but decent)

Libby was so helpful and kind. She made the whole shopping experience a pleasure. | review_rating:1, text:The customer service I experienced from them is all good until I brought my ring to Sunway Pyramid Goldheart on 28 September 2024 to do size adjustment. The adjustment was done on the day and I’ve tried it as well.

They say engraving have to wait till the next day 12pm only can be done, on Sunday I called them they said the ring can be done before 2pm. Unfortunately at 1pm when I’m on my way to Sunway Pyramid I received a call from them, said that the engraving can only be done after 4pm. So I’m not able to collect it on Sunday because I don’t want to waste my time waiting there.

Today 1 October Tuesday, I went to collect my ring but the condition is bad, the surface of the ring is scratched. What I’m angry the most is the staff no inform me at the phone about this until I go and collect it they also didn’t mention about anything to me until I saw the scratches on the ring. I asked them why is it like this. Their answer is this can only be fixed at Hong Kong in 2-3 months time. I send a good condition ring over but received a scratched ring? The staff didn’t mention anything about before I ask. The staff should have realise this issue before hand and inform customer and give customer solution to solve this. When the staff handover to me, she just said, the ring is done adjustment and engraving please check, they didn’t even admit they are sorry for scratched the ring and how they can solve it until I ask them. And the scratches are on top of the ring I don’t believe no one else has seen it.

This kind of customer service attitude are bad because it’s not about how far I came to collect it or am I urgently need to use the ring. We bought the marriage ring to wear it not just to use it. It Is the customer expectation to collect a beautiful fit ring from the shop.

Kindly train your staff again and provide a right compensation to customer. Thank you. | review_rating:5, text:Professional friendly staff here

Kwan Kee Store, a Michelin-recognized spot, is a must-visit for those who appreciate traditional Hong Kong pastries. Their dedication to authentic flavors and quality ingredients is evident in their offerings.

The white sugar sponge cake stands out with its light, fluffy texture and just the right level of sweetness—perfect for those who prefer a more delicate taste. The steamed red bean cake and pandan cake are also excellent, packed with red beans and maintaining a balanced, natural flavor without being overly sweet.

However, the Musang King rice roll falls a bit short. While the concept is interesting, it lacks the strong durian fragrance that one might expect from Musang King, leaving room for improvement in flavor intensity.

Price is on the high side, some might think worth it but some might not. | review_rating:4, text:I've tried a few items but I don't remember the names.

To be honest, among these 2, still prefer Tonkotsu.More cheaper & tasty in my opinion.
Kiwami very oily & not thick enough the taste.
Adding tamago egg & osen tamago egg with RM4 & RM3 respectively.
Honey Almond sago with mint taste good and refreshing.

Total price: RM101.95 (incld 16% tax)

1. Ramen Bankara - RM25.90 - The soup is strong with pork broth, it really comes from the pork bone essence. Taste very nice and ramen is chewy and good.
2. Tsukemen - RM30 - This is special, and had stronger taste. Ramen is much thicker and chewy than Bankara.
3. Chicken Nanban - RM21 - The nanban sauce is mix with mayo, egg and some salad. And the chicken although not hot, but crispy. The mixture of it is nice.
4. Almond Drink - RM11 - Their handmade honey almond drink, it is very dense and the almond taste will not too strong until you hardly accept it. The honey did neutralise the almond flavour.

Overall, it is good choice for ramen, just the price range is slightly at the high side. Recommend 👍🏼 | review_rating:4, text:Tried their recommended Kakuni Bankara, the broth base is shoyu, so expect a quite high level of saltiness. The pork belly has been cooking for so long, it just melts as soon as your chopsticks touch it. Not my kind of noodles, it's on the thicker side, but it grabs onto the broth very well. Just wished they given us the option to choose the level doneness of the noodles. The tsukemen is probably three times the salty level of the ramen, but it's good none the less. The option to add garlic tableside was great. Really elevates the flavour of the broth. | review_rating:4, text:Tried their tonkatsu broth and is flavorsome and thick. Although too salty for me, but will probably suit those who prefers strong flavors. The kakuni and chasiu is tender and juicy,  5 ⭐.

•	Diverse Shopping: With a wide array of shops, it caters to all family members, from fashion to gadgets.
•	Family-Friendly Activities: The mall features an indoor ice-skating rink and a massive arcade that are perfect for kids and adults alike. My daughter loves to play at Parenthood. They have upgraded it too recently and we enjoyed it.
•	Food Haven: Offers an extensive selection of dining options from fast food to upscale restaurants. For Indian food you can try Mantra Restaurant (Not great but decent)
•	Convenient Layout: Despite its size, the mall is well-organized, making navigation easy.
•	Themed Decor: The Egyptian-inspired architecture adds a unique charm, making every visit memorable.

The restaurant has a good ambience and a nice view, overlooking part of Sunway Lagoon.

The fried pork was very crispy, but it had an unpleasant smell and wasn’t tender. The side dishes, like cabbage, rice, and soup, were refillable but not for sharing. Since we were still full, we only ordered one set. | review_rating:4, text:As it is tonkatsu, the menu looks very same for different item, kinda hard to decide what to order.

The pork is hard and take much effort to chew. It's marinated quite well with a unique taste.

Chicken curry is very nice, but chicken portion much smaller and not enough for my liking.

There is a lot of condiments available to mix-in with your meal, the soup and cabbage are freeflow refillable.

DRY AF…. D.R.Y!!!! It’s not enjoyable at ALLL….. the fats on the pork did not do justice… knowing the breadcrumbs around it will
Definitely cut the top of your mouth but expecting the pork meat to be tender or atleast melts in your mouth…. ? NOPE… all is dryyyyyyyy it was hard to chew throughout 6pieces…. My jaw was tired…. Flavor wise, not much, very mild, it’s not mind blowing.

The only Thing that was good was the miso soup that came together.
Service of replenishing cabbage was 👍

This will be my first and my last.. | review_rating:1, text:Same incident happened again. I’ve saw others put a review regarding their service, we really feel disrespectful and being looked down by their staff just because we ask for refill cabbage and soup.

Before we ordered, we did ask the waiter can we share one main course by adding another side dish? If not we just add in the bottomless refill package. (Here i need to mention that I’ve dine in at another branch - Mid Valley so i knew it was workable. And the reason for us to share is we really can’t finish all if we order two main course)

The waiter said OK without explaining anything. But when we ask for refill he take the menu to us said that if u want to refill you need to add the bottomless refill, but we did ask at the very beginning. He said OK! And the way he explain to us is really make us uncomfortable is like we asking for food. But hello? It’s just cabbage? How much it cost? And fine, i know you have your own rules, but why you didn’t mention it clearly at first?

And after that we said nvm, we continue having the rest of our food. After that he suddenly come over and refilled the cabbage for us, without saying anything. This really makes us feel uncomfortably and disrespectful.

Anyway, look at her when we received the ice cream, my message to her is go to hell my love 😊 | review_rating:1, text:I was having a small party at ICE Rink , first order at 3.30pm for 50pcs fried chicken , 60 pcs nuggets and 6pkt french fries . 4.15pm able to pick up all the food , the service at the counter also polite and tell me if need big amount of food need to give them some time to prepare , ok then 4.30pm I place second order for 30pcs fried chicken , 100 pcs nuggets and 10 regular plus 10 large fries , I said I'll be back to collect by 5.30pm , the supervisor said OK .

5.20pm when I'm there order not done , I wait untill 5.45pm my wife call for cake cutting but my order still not prepare yet . after cake cutting the food also consume is time to replenish so I went back at 6.30pm but still no prepare yet , so I just take what ever they had for me except the FRIES.

6.45pm I assume they should prepare all the fries for me , but what await me in front is countless customer waiting for their order , and they keep giving fries to other customer which is I order ahead of them , wasn't that fast food should be first come first serve basic , finally I wait till 7.15pm I fully redeem my order from a sour face staff who throw the packet to me , but I didn't get mad I just want my food asap , no argue no complaint , just to let people know FAST FOOD doesn't mean FAST .",3.8,+60 3-5638 3205,"Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Tuesday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Wednesday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Thursday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Friday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Saturday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Sunday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM"

Ordering: QR order system is hopeless. Doesn’t show everything that is on the actual menu, and also doesn’t show when a certain item is unavailable. Instead, the system crashes when you try to order the item that is unavailable.

Food: They look appealing but I’ve had better food in-flight. No plate for a rock hard sandwich that is 20% edible. Very messy.

Drinks: Fair. | review_rating:5, text:Had some really tasty dessert. The turkey cheese was my highlight and pistachio khunafa a close second. Very buttery, substantial and full of flavors. Might be a bit on the sweet side so best paired with coffee! | review_rating:5, text:It's a lovely cafe with friendly staff & reasonably priced.

The cafe has comfy seats & with a lovely view.

Been here numerous times. The berries smoothie is a favourite.

Tried the chocolate chip cookie & it tasted great...it was warmed slightly & that made it decadent with the chocolate chips melting when bitten Into.

The strawberry tart was mildly sweet.

The matcha latte is a perfect cuppa for matcha lovers. | review_rating:1, text:what would you least expect when visiting 5 stars hotel and accommodations is the ignorance from this restaurant manager,well he was with typical manager attire at cashier, and compromising smiles. it was very unpleasant moment that ruined our new year eve evening eventhough we changed location celebrating new year thereafter. we planned to send an email to explain the situation. we were quite familiar with sunway hotels and resorts both international or in the past of which none had ruined reputation on a travel plan. other create fame. breach of trust upholds intransigent fiasco. | review_rating:5, text:Ordered a Rojan puff and a cappuccino.
