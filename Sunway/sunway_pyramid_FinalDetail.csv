My sister and I just recently purchased innerwear from here (22/4/2023) and the employees there are quite alright, I manage to find my size but my sister took some time in finding it, which she later noticed its not the right size for her on that day when we got back home.

I understand its her incompetence when it comes to choosing something you wear everyday and still able to choose wrong. So we went back to the store for an exchange (24/4/2023) and it's a different staff this time. Though I find this employee to be somewhat irritated due to her tone when she's serving. But the biggest problem was that she secretly CUT OFF the price tag after my sister had finally done choosing the right size WITHOUT informing us and for me, that just leaves a sour taste in my mouth.

I believe staff have to at least inform the customers that they will cut off the price tag due to whatever reasons presents. Either its because customers can only exchange product once or any other reason at all, for the staff to cut off the price tag like that is just another stamp approval of me not visiting this store anymore.

I'm not sure about the name of the employee but I believe the Person in charge can find out who that is.

This lead to a wild spread rebellion spread across the nation. The founders of this food establishment found the best Asian fried chicken, believe or not, in New York’s city on the subway scene. This is where it all began. Their original chicken recipe is more well-known have a fiery sensation which is as intense as their hot and spicy sauce. From there on, they spread their wings to other regions such as Malaysia, Indonesia and Australia to share what they believed.
How do they make their chicken taste so good? Their chicken is specially cooked to using their own house recipe which resulted in an awesome fried chicken that's packed with loads of flavour. They also use only fresh, locally sourced free-range chicken in kitchens which definitely speaks of quality of their own food. What makes their chicken recipe unique, spicy and crispy, it is cooked with natural herbs and spices, with zero artificial flavourings. In addition to that there is no MSG and instead they use naturally fermented soy sauces that packs a punch, offering their food in the most natural way possible.
Their signature Soy Garlic and Hot & Spicy sauces are made the good old fashioned way, fermented naturally using a traditional Asian method (soy beans, water, 5 months of Malaysian sun) and natural herbs and spices. Not only their chicken is great but they also offer a variety of things such as their delicious burgers and sandwiches, seafood and salad to appeal to many.

If you’re on a shopping spree, you won’t want to skip this super cute store that has so much to offer that it’s established itself as ‘a girl’s favourite shopping destination’. Hailing from its headquarters in Hong Kong, the brand started out as a youthful and energetic lingerie brand founded by Erik Ryd, a Swedish entrepreneur with a well-known lingerie manufacturing business in Asia. A few years later, the brand expanded its range of apparel from its adorable to sexy lingerie line, to include nightwear, active wear, denim, tops, dresses, pants, loungewear and accessories.
As this shopping haven expands to become one of the fastest-growing fashion brands in Asia, it now has more than 200 outlets and counting all over. Lion is proud to say that the brand’s first outlet on Malaysian shores opened right here at Sunway Pyramid in 2019! When they first opened their doors to all fashion-adoring shoppers, Lion was curious to find out what the intriguing name of their store meant. Turns out, the meaning behind 6IXTY8IGHT’s unique name has its roots in Chinese numerology. Since Cantonese is the main dialect spoken in Hong Kong, their pronunciation for the numbers 6 and 8 have phonetic similarities to a phrase resembling “Forever luck!”.
There’s definitely something for everyone here. With their wide range of lingerie that’s either cute and quirky, or sexy and alluring, it’s amazing how comfortable and affordable it is too - who ever said you can’t have the best of both worlds? Even their outerwear is nothing short of stylish chic, great to mix and match for every occasion – whether it’s that perfect date outfit, or for a day out with friends, or even to your office.

From the beginning, I felt something was off, but I didn’t expect to be left so frustrated by the end of the session. The technician didn’t inform me that she was a trainee until the very end, which would have been helpful to know upfront. The lack of experience was painfully evident throughout the entire process.

The session took over 2 and a half hours, which I found completely unnecessary, especially since I was only getting a basic gel manicure with no color. I had specifically asked for nail extensions prior, but I was told that they would take too long. However, even with just a simple gel application, the technician insisted that coloured gel wouldn’t look good on my short nails, and in the end, my nails were actually cut even shorter during the process.

The results were far from what I expected. My nails look uneven, and the entire experience was frustrating and uncomfortable. I left feeling like I had wasted both my time and money.

To make matters worse, the next day, I noticed that my thumb nail wasn’t even coated with the last layer of gel. I returned to the salon to ask them to at least put on the top coat, but when they did, it ended up looking completely different in color because the worker allegedly forgot what shade she had used. It’s hard to believe that such an oversight could happen at a salon, especially with something as simple as a top coat.

I really wish the salon had been more transparent about the technician’s skill level beforehand. I won’t be returning or recommending this place to anyone. | review_rating:1, text:Went here for gel manicure . It cost me rm78. But the service is lousy. Such a lazy and rude staff.

Additionally, the curly fries were served cold, suggesting they had been sitting out for hours. The root beer float lacked fizziness and was served without a straw, which was inconvenient.

A big shout out to stylist Vaan. He’s so meticulous and he managed to do all of the items within 2 hours as I have a flight to catch. Every step of the chemical treatment there’s scalp protector and additional ampoule to not be so painful for my scalp during the chemical processes and he kept checking on my hair and whether I can take the pain.  He is also very good at picking colours- I only do cool tone colours and without me saying he already mixed the silver-gray as a colour to uniformly tone my colour.

Each item are resonable priced and well seasoned to entice the appetite and still be wallet-friendly, with a slight variation in menu on a daily basis to encourage repeat customers to pop by during their lunch or tea breaks. ABC One Cafeteria is also capable of catering to events that has been pre-arranged with their cooks.

The sales person initially encouraged to go for 2 items for 30% discount. After that, ask us why not we go for more, as if we go for more than 2 items, we will get additional 10% discount on top of the 30% discount. So, because of this, we get the kids to try on their shoes and the kids are in love with the sport shoes. However, to our much disappointment, when we are about to pay, we feel weird, that the calculation didnt match what we were told, and the sales person just told us that, sorry, the promotion had ended a day earlier, but how can? as a big company did such a mistake. We still ended up buying because we didnt want the kids to be upset after choosing and trying and confirming their shoes, we ended paying RM87x instead of RM79x. This is really so unprofessional way, how can the staff be so unprofessional, or the company no notification of the promotion ended? I appreciate Anta to reply us for this matter.

I went here because I've been to APT Salon several times when I lived in Penang and the service and quality there was good. And even prices were very reasonable.
Over here, in Sunway Pyramid, they charged me 60+ RM for my thin hair. I was still okay to pay because I wanted good service.
The person who washed my hair couldn't understand a word of English. He took me directly to the hair wash basin for the wash, unlike how it used to be done at the Penang branch. Before starting I asked him to shampoo only once as my hair tends to get too dry with double shampooing. But he went ahead and shampooed twice anyway.
Then when he was applying conditioner I requested that he leave it on for a couple of minutes so it can actually condition my hair and he said ok, but washed it off in less than 15 seconds. 🤷‍♀️
Then, while blowdrying he used the high heat blast from the very beginning and kept bringing it very close to my scalp. And he kept focussing on the back of my scalp while the front was just airdrying and setting to become kind-of messy-frizzy..
After he was done I had to ask him to apply hair serum, and That's something that he should have done without me asking considering how sadly he had blow-dried my hair.
After the wash my scalp has been completely damaged. It's been almost 3 weeks now since this hair wash and my scalp has not recovered yet. The back portion of my scalp is still soar and extremely itchy and i usually never have an itchy scalp. I've never faced this issue ever before. I'm not sure if it's bad products used or bad technique or both together, but it's ruined my scalp. All I wanted was a relaxing hair wash. But instead left disappointed with a damaged scalp.
One thing salon Staff should understand is that everyone coming there has different hair types and should be handled according to that. ONE METHOD/FORMULA DOESN'T FIT ALL when it comes to hair. Especially in Malaysia where you find a mix of people from so many ethnicities it's expected all the more.
Anyway all in all, bad service and disappointing experience.

After we decided to purchase a few items, we noticed a change in behavior from one of the staff members who became friendlier. However, the other staff member still maintained an unprofessional and unfriendly demeanor, which was a letdown.

If you look different that doesn't mean you are different from others finally what matters is your character. A stranger can't judge you by your appearance. No matter your age or gender, your body’s largest organ is your skin. If you want your skin especially on the face to look its best and stay healthy, you need to take care of it. Healthy, good looking skin begins with skin care. Facials are an essential ingredient of your overall skin care program and you will love the benefits of facials. A facial is a spa therapy and massage that leaves your skin cleaner, softer, younger, and truly transformed. Facials can help clear clogged pores, quench parched skin and remove dead cells.

Puffiness reduction, sagging in the face and skin cell renewal are additional benefits from these massage techniques.

Aeroline Penang—Corus Hotel KL

Trip started PROMPTLY at 8:30 AM, no delays. Driver and crew, Faiz was very nice. They helped with check in, seat directory and baggage. The driver was very skilful when navigating through the narrow roads. In one instance, it was a 2 lane road and there was one car illegally parked.  The driver still managed to drive by without even needing to reverse.

At around 8:35, Faiz came down the row with comfy blue blankets and headphones.  The headphones worked great with the on-board entertainment (OBE). The OBE was equipped with many movies and songs, of different genres.

At about 9, Faiz served food to us. It had spicy rice, potato wedges and egg. The food was 9/10, tasty! He also served hot drinks which also tasted great!

The rest of the trip, he went around a few times to collect trash.

There was one stop at a fuel station for 15 MINUTES break.

At about 1PM-1:30PM, we arrived at Corus Hotel. Driver was nice enough to let me take videos of the bus.

2 mineral water bottles with Aeroline branding is provided.

Overall, awesome ride. It deserves more than 5 stars!

Traditional favorites have long ingrained itself into the taste bud of every person, regardless of which social class you are in, be it the rich man and his craving for the decadent roadside Ramly burger or a simple office worker looking forward to a hearty lunch of char koey teow.
Ah Cheng Laksa is one of those establishments that brings out the best in a local delicacy and transport the eater on a journey away from the stress of the day. Offering a varied menu of local mains and side dishes, the main item to stand out is the infamous laksa (it IS in the name after all, in case anyone is wondering)! With their secret inhouse blend of spices for the laksa soup base, they have elevated the aromatic taste of the dish to new levels of tastiness. For an added twist, customers are encouraged to add the pungent ‘otak udang’ sauce, which is a black paste made from prawn innards to give a special zest to the flavor. Adventurous customers can add some squeezed lime juice and fried onions to the soup, creating a memorable sensation that is hard to forget.
To bolster the delicious laksa, the menu also carries fried chicken meat rolls, more commonly known as the ‘lobak’, which compliments the laksa’s taste. The presence of a meaty dish gives the meal a hearty and filling feel, which may be lacking from just the laksa alone, as the sour-ish soup stimulates the appetite further as you enjoy your meal.

We complained, they said they can't do much as their factory is in Ipoh (who care where is your factory as I'm buying from AKEMI).

We even asked them to exchange the SHOW ROOM UNIT with the new SOFA SET that they delivered but they said cannot.
We went to the store want them to send their staff to personally go to our house to ""feel"" the sofa delivered but they declined.

I was served by a sales executive (I’ve forgotten his name, a skinny softie Malay guy) I was looking for a pair of sandals, while browsing around, a beautiful and comfy pair catches my eyes.The shopping experience was unfriendly. We are not welcomed by the team at the first stage. Not even a single word or voice from the so called sales executive during attending me. I’m the one who approaching him and asking for the size availability, asking for the ongoing promotions and things lead into the payment stage at the cashier counter. My shopping was less than 10 minutes until the payment stage. It’s just a pair of sandals cost at RM229 (if I’m not mistaken with the accurate price) The guy passed me an iPad without saying anything by putting it on the cashier directly in front of me. When looked into it ,noted that was a CRM customer details membership form and I just fill in the the details. I have doubt with the “password” column. Therefore , I clarify with the staff “excuse me, may I know why & what the password required for? “ It was unexpected that the staff’s attitude was rude instead of explaining to me regarding my concerns, he took the iPad from me directly key in & reconfirm the required password by himself. What an attitude????
Not even saying anything but showing his annoying face and the body signs was so OMG!!!!
It was really a big turn off and ruined my shopping experience! I’ve changed my mind not to proceed the the purchase. I’ll make it short into conclusion, it was unpleasant shopping experience, very rude customer service manners, staffs training not up to the standard in retails & customer service line.

This was the birthplace of Arabian Oud. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz Al Jasser founded the store with one mission – to source and expertly blend the best oils and scents in the world. This uncompromising dedication to quality still guides the brand today. Arabian Oud has grown from its origins in the Alzal souk to become the largest Arabian fragrance house in the world. We have taken our oriental perfumes and oils, sourced and blended from the finest ingredients, to international markets, gaining many loyal fans as we have expanded. Today we boast over 900 stores worldwide, and our unique, luxurious perfumes are worn by customers from more than 36 countries worldwide. The most highly-prized ingredient of a perfumer’s palette, oud is said to be the first pure incense found on earth. Derived from dark resin found in the trunk of centuries old Aquilaria trees, this unique perfume has a cultural and religious significance dating back to ancient civilisations. Oud has a deep woody scent that persists and evolves over the whole day. Our team of oud hunters practice unwritten rites handed down from generation to generation. Native to southeast Asia, the rare, resinous heartwood forms in the trunks and roots of trees infected with a parasitic mould. Our oud hunters work tirelessly to source and harvest the finest Agarwood, while respecting the delicate balance of nature to conserve this scarce prize for future generations. Our dedicated team of world renowned perfumers and bottle designers promise perfection in every blend. Using their wealth of experience, they sensitively combine exquisite ingredients in beautiful bottles to showcase the very finest in oriental perfumery.

I was told by the receptionist lady that there was no masseuse available, so I thought a masseur would do because I had requested a 1 hour head, shoulder, and back massage. I told the lady to tell him to avoid from the sensitive areas like the chest and underarms.
We agreed & proceed with the payment.

However, there are a few things that have severely disappointed me:

1. The masseur asked me to lie face down and begin with leg massage. I was confused and asked him, but his response was brief: ""wait"" till he focused on so much of my hip, at which point I asked if he could start with head and shoulder massage?

2. When we continue with the head and shoulder massage, he tends to “massage” my chest, which makes me feel so uncomfortable that I have to stop him right away.

3. He assumed the massage was 30mins instead of 60 mins until I ask him to double check with the receptionist again.

4. I think they need proper training / professional training, comparable what he has done on the right side, but it was different on the left. Either too much emphasis on the right or only for a short time on the left.

5. Overall experience was really bad due to poor communication. Even if you ask a basic question, either no response or unable to communicate.

The skin on my face is more sensitive and prone to spots than ever. I have started to get breakouts on my chin which I have never done before! My pores are more open I feel which is where the breakouts come from. the forehead also have stubborn breakouts that won’t go even with 2 months on highly rated dermalogica products such as the “age bright serum” which was super expensive yet has done little for my breakouts. Before this acne treatment, my “acne” was hardly noticeable and persistent but after this treatment it is due to my skin being more sensitive. I am extremely disappointed and frustrated. As I am from abroad and was only staying at Malaysia for short-term, I am not able to make a complaint in person or fight to get compensation - so I leave this review to warn other customers. If your skin breakouts aren’t severe and inflammatory, just go for natural treatments. This one was intensive and only made my skin worse. | review_rating:5, text:I have been a member of Aster Spring from the time it opened till present and Tracy (Sunway Pyramid branch) has always been very helpful, polite and I just love her facials plus product recommendations.

Now that I’m home, I realize they are indeed uneven, and even people around me can notice the difference.

But I've noticed the drop in food quality.

The chicken doesn't smell and taste fresh. The colour of the fried chicken is dark and dull in colour (as compared to the past, and also compared to other penyet shops).

The dark colour of the chicken doesn't feels alright to me. But since I've ordered, I just finish it, and see what will happen @@.

The sambal also look different too, now very dull in colour, watery and doesn't have the good sambar chilli smell.

I'll try out another shop that is newly open in the mall instead next time. | review_rating:1, text:Disappointing and Unfair Treatment

I had a very disappointing experience at this restaurant. A group of eight people before me was allowed to dine in, but when I, alone, asked for a table, I was refused without any clear explanation. The waitress seemed willing to accept my request, but the cashier refused. This inconsistency in service made me feel unwelcome and unfairly treated. If there are specific policies about solo diners, they should be communicated clearly and applied consistently. Unfortunately, based on this experience, I wouldn’t recommend this place to others. | review_rating:3, text:Delicious and spicy sambal and dish. Need improvement on the fried chicken and fish.

It was already dinner time for us all. We didn’t want any Chinese nor Western food . So we walked around the restaurants here to pick n choose what best to eat. So my niece who is rather adventurous , wanted to try some Indonesian food. We also happened to pass by this restaurant called Bebek Goreng Pak Ndut that serves duck n chicken cuisine Indonesian style. So we took a table n ordered our dinner. We ordered 2 pax of grilled duck n original duck plus another 2 pax of crispy fried chicken n grilled chicken. The food, to our surprise, was good . The prices were also reasonable. There were some Malay as well as some Chinese customers too. After our dinner when we left , we saw their special promotions during weekdays from 2.30pm - 5.30 pm. | review_rating:4, text:The duck is crispy outside and soft and fluffy inside thus making it very delectable.

Nothing to shout about. It's too dry for my liking. At least the sambal provides a good cover. The cracker also not all is crunchy.

So, overall it's just mid. | review_rating:4, text:Food (Bebek Goreng/Bakar) - it is good as expected and definitely value for money. Perhaps just change the raw cabbage with some other veggies that can be eaten raw by most people.

Food (Beef soto betawi) - This was my original order but I asked to cancel because the beef was tough (tougher than your bully brother lol). Like real tough, plus the ligaments of the meat is everywhere. 😂 I asked to change to bebek goreng.

Service - This is Awesome! Overall the crew was kind and nice. One of the crew even ask me to do this review, which I don’t want to. Haha but he insisted so that they can continue to improve!

from our own secret family recipes. Our name comes from the Malay word “bungkus” (take
away) and the Hokkien word “kaw” (thick).
Just say “bungkus kaw kaw” and you’ll get an authentic, full-bodied Malaysian drink to go,
packed in a plastic bag and secured with a red plastic cord that also serves as a carrier sling.
Quench your thirst with authentic, traditional drinks like Teh Tarik, Kopi or Cham. We aim to
be in every town and city in Malaysia, so everybody can say “Bungkus Kaw Kaw!”
With the influx of foreign coffee franchises, it has become difficult to buy authentic
traditional beverages, especially in shopping malls and offices. Bungkus Kaw Kaw’s mission is
to make these familiar favourites widely available again, made fresh-to-order in the original,
full-flavoured way, at an affordable price. And like all self-respecting mamaks, kopitiams and
warungs, we have our own home-made secret recipes and pride ourselves on pulling no
punches in giving you the strongest, perfect traditional brew.
Our signature drinks, Kopi Kaw Kaw, Teh Tarik Kaw Kaw and Cham Kaw Kaw are made the
good old-fashioned way to ensure the taste of authenticity and traditional. Not only our
lokal drinks are great, we also offer a variety of foods such as Nasi Lemak, Chee Cheong Fun,
Loh Mai Kai, Bihun Siam, Kuih Muih, Roti Bakar, etc. That shape our Malaysian culture today!
Now we are available in Sunway Pyramid, this is a great addition for everyone to enjoy a
lokal authentic drink or food from its taste of Malaysia. To satisfy your lokal cravings, do give
Bungkus Kaw Kaw a try!",LG2.75A (Lower Ground 2 Floor),"LG2.75A, 3, Jalan PJS 11/15, Bandar Sunway, 46150 Petaling Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia","review_rating:3, text:The taste of the nasi lemak bungkus is no longer what it was. The sambal udang taste was flat. Non-spicy.

I recently visited Bungkus Kawkaw at Sunway Pyramid and was thoroughly impressed with my meal. The New Nasi Lemak Rendang was a highlight - the rendang sauce was creamy, spicy, and perfectly balanced, served with a side of fragrant coconut rice.

To quench my thirst, I opted for the Teh Kawkaw, which was a strong and bold black tea that hit the spot.

The ordering process was efficient - simply pay and wait for your food to be prepared. The wait was well worth it, as the food was freshly prepared and packed with flavor.

Overall, I highly recommend Bungkus Kawkaw for a satisfying and delicious meal.

I had one of the worst dining experiences at this restaurant. Despite six empty tables, we had to wait 30 minutes just for the staff to clean one so we could sit. The place is clearly understaffed, crammed and the existing employees work extremely slowly—taking orders, serving food, and even handling payments not within stipulated time-frame which leads for congestion and long queue.

Most frustrating and disappointing scenarios is thier very own employee is serving the customers without break time and most of the suffering with empty stomach for accomplishing duty.

The lack of crowd management and efficiency is frustrating, especially for hungry customers waiting for food. If you value your time and good service, this is not the place to visit. Definitely not worth the wait! | review_rating:4, text:Would have given 5 star if not for that poor service. Waited for some time for a table even though there were empty ones but not cleared. One staff had the audacity to ask to move from a bigger table (cleared) to a smaller table (dirty and full of uncleared dishes). She should have the courtesy to clear the smaller table before asking anyone to change table.

Anyway, food was good and portion was generous.

Business was especially brisk during festive seasons for this high-quality traditional delicacy, which Mr Teo Swee Ee introduced as ‘bakkwa’. Through his passion for calligraphy and divination, he created the Bee Cheng Hiang brand name, 美珍香. Each character is composed with nine calligraphic strokes, signifying brand longevity and a representation of the Bee Cheng Hiang experience. Today, the brand has spread across many parts of the world, including our very own Sunway Pyramid!
Visitors to their shops are treated to the sight, smell and taste of our products. Unchanged since 1933, their recipe retains the traditional taste, and is uncompromising in quality. Each bakkwa are still hand crafted, over traditional bamboo sieves. That’s why no two pieces are the same. The meat is smoked for hours over the slow burning flames of charcoal.
Bee Cheng Hiang is more than just a ‘bakkwa’ company. Their Vision is to be Asia’s leading food company: providing quality products and services to the global market. In a world where food safety is of utmost importance, customers can enjoy their products with a peace of mind. Each bakkwa are made with 100% natural ingredients, without added meat tenderizer, preservatives, artificial flavouring or colouring and MSG.
This has remained true since their inception in 1933 and remains true today. Today, with more than 370 outlets in 12 territories, Bee Cheng Hiang is still committed to their core mission to be the best at helping people to experience and share enjoyable moments in everyday life.",LG2.58A (Lower Ground 2 Floor),"3, Jalan PJS 11/15, Bandar Sunway, 46150 Petaling Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia","review_rating:5, text:Good experience here.

1. Pathumtani beef rice noodle (soy sauce based)
2. Ayutthaya chicken spring noodle (stronger herbal broth)
3. Creamy tom yum chicken rice noodle (seasonal, spicy and yummy!)

We had the opportunity to experience an invigorating icy-cold onsen at 9°C, soaking just one leg in was enough to make me shiver and go numb! I can't imagine fully submerging my entire body. To maximize the benefits, it's essential to follow the correct sequence, and thanks to Cyrus, the beauty manager, we learned how to do it properly. Otherwise, we might have just jumped straight into the pool without knowing what’s best! 😜

Next, we proceeded through three hot onsen pools in sequence:

1️⃣ Skin Renewal Micro Nano Bubble Onsen (36°C)
🇯🇵 Deep cleanses and provides anti-aging benefits. This was our favorite, as our skin felt incredibly smooth while soaking in the pool.

2️⃣ Revitalizing Hydroluxe Therapy Onsen (38°C)
🇯🇵 Oxygenates the skin and muscles, allowing the skin to ""breathe"" better. According to Cyrus, this pool is perfect for my partner, as her youthful skin benefits from the oxygenation, keeping it supple and radiant.

3️⃣ Detoxifying Salt Onsen (40°C)
🇯🇵 Restores the skin’s natural glow. As per Cyrus’ advice, this pool was best suited for me, especially considering my age and muscle strain in my shoulders. It helped relieve deep muscle tension and provided much-needed relaxation.

Gradually increasing the temperature allows the body to adjust safely, preventing dizziness or discomfort that may occur due to sudden temperature changes.

Throughout our experience, Jane, the attentive attendant, ensured we were well taken care of. She even noticed I was wearing a necklace and kindly reminded me to remove it, as the heat could cause discomfort when wearing gold. 👍

Finally, after a 5 minute rest, we moved on to the Volcanic Himalayan Salt Sauna Room, which was another new and exciting experience. The walls were beautifully designed with volcanic Himalayan salt, known for its relaxation and respiratory health benefits, including relief for sinus issues.

Inside the sauna, there were two levels of benches. We started on the lower bench with milder heat before moving to the upper bench, where the intensity increased. The moment I sat on the second bench, sweat immediately started dripping from my forehead and neck, such an invigorating detox!

Overall, I truly loved my experience here with my niece. Body Perfect is a trusted, government-recognized brand, ensuring peace of mind with proper documentation and signatures to protect both parties throughout the procedure. This added an extra layer of trust to the entire journey.

A heartfelt thank you to Sunway Pyramid and Body Perfect Aesthetic & Wellness for giving me a whole new level of relaxation, an experience I can continue to enjoy, even after returning from my recent Japan trip!

P/S: You don't need to worry hearing the word ""Onsen"", they do provide disposable bra and panty ya. Kind of certain transparency but still rather than nothing right? 😂 And psst..they provide other 100 type of services(facial,slimming, wellness, women care,etc) which you may try out.

These exquisite pieces come in various sizes, colours and styles to choose from - there's a pearl for every girl! They offer both freshwater and seawater pearls in the form of necklaces, rings, bracelets and earrings. Interesting fact about their products, freshwater pearls are formed in mussels, whereas saltwater pearls are formed in oysters! These exclusive pearls from Borneo will enhance any outfit whether it’s with their classic or contemporary design.
They even offer Golden South Sea pearls, originating from the largest pearl-producing oyster, hence generally larger than most saltwater pearl varieties and take a longer time grow, estimated to grow between 2-4 years. So how are these prized South Sea beauties valued? It typically depends mostly on the colour of the pearl! Rare and highly desired, they range from beautiful shades of creamy white to deep gold, with shades of yellow and champagne falling in between. Pearls that have a deeper golden colour are considered more valuable, such as how the deepest golden colour, being referred to as 24 karat, is said to be the most valuable colour for South Sea pearls. However, these pearls may not be perfectly spherical as they have very thick nacre. When pearls are harvested, there is usually a large amount of drop pearls, baroque pearls, circle pearls and button pearls.

BURGER KING commenced its earliest operations in Malaysia in 1997 with the opening of its first restaurant at the Sungai Buloh Overhead Bridge. Today, Cosmo Restaurants Sdn Bhd operates more than 50 BURGER KING restaurants all across Malaysia, where customers across the country can enjoy the great and healthy flame-grilled taste of Burger King products. Beyond just burgers, Burger King's menu has expanded from a basic offering of burgers, French fries, sodas, and milkshakes to a larger and more diverse set of products. In 1957, the ""Whopper"" became the first major addition to the menu, and it has become Burger King's signature product since. Burger King has also tailored its menu for regional tastes. With a local twist of variations to their burgers and menu, Burger King has introduced many interesting menus such as the infamous limited edition Nasi Lemak Burger and Satay Burgers, as well as the Nasi King combo to cater to their Asian customers. Even their drinks and side orders are varied from time to time, especially during festive periods such as Raya!

However, when I prepared to wash it, I found a very noticeable defect on the sleeves, making the dress unwearable. This issue is unacceptable, especially since I trusted their assurance of the dress’s condition.

I have reached out to the shop to request an exchange or refund, but they have completely ignored me. This experience has been incredibly disappointing. Selling defective items while claiming they’re in perfect condition, especially for CNY, shows a lack of professionalism and care for customers.

Quoting what that gentleman says ""upgrading a lps for a DC in product makes no sense, as it's not 240V AC in type"" you can't compare.

You are feeling a bit lost here? No worries, I believe he has no idea what he is talking about, they even bash their own product and having the mindset of expensive stuff must always be better. I believe a salesman who works in Hi-end HiFi shop should have the basic knowledge, having someone shytting on the brand they carry just because it's cheaper, and the fact that he doesn't appreciate the difference a good power supply can do in a system even for a DC in product, I don't think that guy is qualified for the job.

Furthermore, the guy is being very impatient and kinda rude, you will get a feeling of they don't want to serve you if you don't bring a stack of cash and put it on the counter to show them you are a serious buyer. Definitely would not buy from such guy even if I like the system.

As someone who has bought from other CMY branch, I feel disappointed with such service was provided.

There are more to add, when I try to test him out if he knows what he is selling. the product definitely said ""analog volume"", which switches between relays for the volumes control. When I bring up this topic, he is very sure that it's a false claim from the manufacturer, he claims that all manufacturers claim so, but it's a chip base digital gain volume control.

•	Food Haven: Offers an extensive selection of dining options from fast food to upscale restaurants. For Indian food you can try Mantra Restaurant (Not great but decent)
•	Convenient Layout: Despite its size, the mall is well-organized, making navigation easy.
•	Themed Decor: The Egyptian-inspired architecture adds a unique charm, making every visit memorable.

Sesame Chicken Claypot ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Suancai Fish ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Long review:
In my 4th visit, I decided not to go for those chicken hotpot options and settled for a sesame chicken claypot and suancai fish. Yes, even Chicken Claypot House cannot deny the popularity of this dish now in Malaysia and has introduced it into their menu as a seasonal offer.
Sesame Chicken Claypot ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
I thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The sauce was really savory with just enough of that sesame taste. In addition to that, the finely chopped and pre-fried ginger gave this dish that extra fragrant taste. So it was not good for my dieting plan as I ended up having two and a half bowl of rice just because of it. The chicken was also pre-marinated I believe. It was flavorful although the kitchen staff gave me mostly chicken breast.

One criticism I have for this restaurant is its rice. It's very lumpy and has limited the joy of having this sauce on the rice. 1 star for the rice.

Suancai Fish ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
For this dish, it came in a humongous bowl. There's not a lot of fish slices but the quality of the fish is there. No earthy taste unlike Tai Er. For me, that is my number one criteria when it comes to eating fish. To be fair to Tai Er, the first and the last time I was there was about one and half years ago. I hope things have changed now for them. Coming back to Chicken Claypot House's version, the peppercorn soup gives you quite the heat after consuming it for a while. But it was good and I like the fact that the sourish taste did not go overboard as to render it acidic in taste. Another important thing to note is that it did not come with a THICK layer of oil unlike the others that I have tried before. So I did not have to spend time filtering away the oil. So it does hold up well to other restaurants that specialize in this dish. | review_rating:4, text:Soups are super tasty and big bowl .love the fish soup portion reasonable come with 龟苓膏 and herbal tea. Recommended. | review_rating:4, text:1. Signature claypot chicken: It was delicious and paired well with rice. The chicken was flavorful.

2. Herbal chicken soup: Just okay. The herbal taste wasn't particularly strong, with limited chicken pieces.

3. Fish head steamboat: A new addition to the menu. The dish had a decent taste.

Generally, the food here had a heavy flavor and left us feeling quite thirsty after the meal. It was enjoyable, but we would recommend having a beverage on hand to counterbalance the strong taste. | review_rating:3, text:Indoor aircond environment, not to worry having steamboat even under warm weather.

I recently visited this restaurant after being drawn in by a 50% discount promotion. Unfortunately, the experience left me feeling underwhelmed and questioning the value for money. Here’s a breakdown of my visit:

Atmosphere ★★★★☆ (4/5)
The restaurant has a cozy and inviting vibe with wooden tables and tasteful decorations. Since it’s located inside a mall, the air conditioning keeps the space comfortable, making it a pleasant spot to sit and relax. However, the ambiance didn’t quite make up for the other shortcomings.

Service ★★★☆☆ (3/5)
The ordering process is straightforward—you place your order at the counter, and the staff delivers it to your table. While the staff was polite, it took about 10 minutes for our food to arrive, which is reasonable but not particularly fast. The service was average, with no standout moments of hospitality.

Food ★★☆☆☆ (2/5)
The food was disappointing overall. The portions were noticeably smaller than advertised, and the quality didn’t justify the price.
•	Chicken Katsu Cromburger ★★☆☆☆ (2/5):
The burger looked promising at first glance, with fresh and soft bread. However, the chicken was tough and difficult to chew, which ruined the dish. I added scrambled eggs and vegetables for an extra RM8, but they were bland and didn’t add much flavor.
•	Chicken Pepperoni Croissant ★★★☆☆ (3/5):
This dish fared slightly better than the cromburger. The croissant was flaky and buttery, but the chicken pepperoni filling lacked seasoning and excitement. It was edible but not memorable.
The overall taste of the dishes felt uninspired, with no standout flavors or attention to detail in preparation.

Price ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5)
This is where things went downhill fast. The 50% discount promotion was misleading—it only applied if you ordered an overpriced drink. I ended up ordering a Bloody Mocha with Cheese for nearly RM17, which was overly sweet and gimmicky. With additional charges like RM8 for scrambled eggs, my total bill for two people came to almost RM78 after taxes. For this price, I expected much higher quality food and larger portions.

Parking - N/A
Since this restaurant is located inside a mall, parking depends entirely on the mall’s facilities. It wasn’t an issue during my visit, but this will vary based on location and time of day.

Final Verdict: Not Worth Revisiting
With its tricky marketing tactics, overpriced menu items, and below-average food quality, I won’t be returning to this restaurant anytime soon. While the atmosphere was pleasant enough, it doesn’t make up for the lackluster dining experience or poor value for money. If you’re looking for better options in this price range, there are plenty of other restaurants that offer superior quality at a fairer price.
Ideal Times to Visit: If you’re still curious about trying this place despite its flaws, visiting during off-peak hours might ensure faster service and a quieter atmosphere.

The cinnabun taste as good as before when the open in NU sentral and i have bought many times from there when i passed by however when i tried once from sunway pyramid ,the cinnabon taste is completely different , it does not taste like previous, the bun is very hard and dry, just like some cinamon bread i can get from any bakery shop. afterwards, I give another chance to get from Nu sentral again and thought its was the outlet issues , unfortunately the taste is just worse like sunway pyramid.

Cinnabon isn’t cheap and quite pricy for many people, so when we get this type of low quality food will double the disappointment… hope the owner can have a quality control and dont use cheap flour just to earn more money! | review_rating:4, text:Biscoff mini cinnamon was good .

The brand became synonymous with its famous Desert Boots, a pair of distinctive ankle-high boots made from calf suede leather, with a crepe rubber sole. Catering to both the needs and desire of men and women, their footwear comes in vast range of styles and collections. Men and women who seek comfortable footwear that makes them look sophisticated and classy should stop by Clarks and try on these different collections: Clarks Originals, boots, sandals, shoes, CloudSteppers, trigenic and unstructured. Or if you’re more inclined to a specific design, you can always opt to shop based on the various styles they offer.
For the men, if you’re looking for something that’s easy to wear, try on their range of slips ons. Need something that you can move around quickly in? Check out their practical yet still fashionable pairs of sneakers. Loafers, lace ups, casual and smart styles are also available to cater to everyone’s preference.
Women can either don on a pair of heels or wedges to add on extra height while looking effortlessly chic. If you’re required to walk around for hours and don’t think heels are the most practical option, not to worry, Clarks has got you covered with their flats, loafers, slips on, lace up, sneakers, smart and casual styles as well.
Now Lion has an idea for those of you shopping at Clarks, why not both you and your significant other get a matching style or collection?

I got a pain au chocolat and a caramel latte for 9.50 and 16.00 respectively, totalling to 27.05 after tax, which is a little steep of a pricing to be honest, but its just a little more expensive than usual cafe prices nowadays, so its still acceptable.

the pain au chocolat was average, nothing extraordinary, it had nice layers and a fair amount of chocolate inside, but for the price, I personally wouldn’t get it again, but it’s not bad.
the caramel latte was actually quite enjoyable, it fit my tastes well, it’s somewhat sweet with good caramel flavour, but not overwhelmingly sweet, and the coffee flavour was present but more mellow than others i’d say, which is still quite nice. and their ice is really crunchy👍🧊

service was standard too, order and pay at counter, get a beeper thing, take a seat and wait until it beeps to go get your order.

overall not bad, would be back again to try different things.

On 2nd of February 2019, at 8:58 I had a nasty encounter with 3 cashiers with foul attitudes towards me wanting to swap my change for a better note (the one they gave me had a significantly big hole on it) as not all stores accept torn notes. The male cashier (MUHD SYAFIQ) pretended to exchange the note but instead gave me the same one with a hole (he covered it with his fingers). The other male (AHMAD AMNAN) who was in charge of handling my purchase completely ignored my request to change notes and walked off. Not only are the staff ignorant and dishonest, a female salesperson/cashier (idrk) mocked at my request to change notes. She even made the comment saying ""It is still accepted"" and continued to make rude comments on me to her co-workers.

Came to the store and requested the dress Im looking for. Went to fitting room and started changing.

The fitting room there were no doors only curtain that hang at the door frame to cover.
2 curtains from both sides per fitting room.

Was changing the dress halfway. The owner did not ask for my consent not inform me anything and just barged in and looked at me wearing the dress halfway. She asked ok or not after that and thought Ididnt know how to wear the dress correctly as ifs upside down/flippers over. I said ok then I said I can do it I'm wearing now. Then she left but the curtain was left opened about half.

Complaints:
Did not ask for my permission/consent before coming in.
Did not inform me verbally before coming in.
Did not have my INFORMED CONSENT before coming in.
Invasion of privacy (doesn't matter if they have their clothes on or not)
The cctv was angled outside the fitting room. This incident was RECORDED and there is a solid evidence. If there's none from the footage, I believe you have probably deleted it. But I have witnesses as well.

I've read your reviews and turns out I'm not the only victim that encounter this. You either apologize or might as well shut down the store. With that kind of behavior I don't think anyone would even come and help/support with your business.

I felt to traumatized and speechless during that incident because it was very random and unexpected and I was not even informed. I was so close to burst out in tears full of fear but I managed to handle it well.

So what if you're a female? Does that give you any rights for you to just barged in like that without my consent? You're not even my family member nor friends what gives you the right to treat your customers like that? Did no one teach you how to respect others privacy?

Please fix your behavior. I will not report you to the police but I will make sure others know about your behavior. Either you fix it now or you can start to prepare yourself in court.

The place was rather busy n at one point , customers had to queue up at the payment counter to make their payment. We browsed through the various sections of this store. It was full of different types of goods ranging from cosmetics, household, clothes, kitchen utensils n cutlery,stationery to even food n beverage. You name it n you can find almost anything here. No wonder so many people like to shop here. The prices are really reasonable n most items are usually priced at only RM 5.90 only. Except for other bigger n more expensive items- these come with a higher price. You can shop at your own leisure without any sales person breathing down your neck. What I bought were a pair of bathroom slippers,a face towel, a plastic comb , a plastic brush, 2 pairs of reading glasses n a few packets of munchies. We had to queue up when making payments. | review_rating:5, text:The staff in all the outlets, not just this store are full of Filipinos, I always thought that I were in Philippines more than in Japan or Malaysia when  I visited Daiso, until I heard of Japanese song & woke up from Manila. But during my recent visit in May 2024, it started to see some local staff working there, especially as Cashier. This store is popular among young people, student, foreigner & tourist, especially female. Even though, the Japanese Yen had been down to the Forex rate of 3.0 but the price is never down but keep on increasing. Previously back to 3-4 years ago due to high Forex of Japanese Yen, Daisho keep on increased the price.

However, today (Oct 6) when I was about to check out, a local cashier was chit chatting with her colleague and didn't provide me with any basic payment info's properly. When I requested to scan my Sunway Pals, she impatiently told me I should have mentioned it earlier and processed it without saying thank you. Shouldn't it be her responsibility to ask the customer beforehand, rather than the customer having to make the request?

I hope the management here provides proper training so that poor staff attitudes don't affect the shopping experience of customers, especially in such a prosperous mall. | review_rating:5, text:Very spacious outlet.

The food was quite good. They were grilled and fried nicely, with balanced taste. However, the portion was quite small, considering the price was on the higher side. The Lebanese coffee was  good. Services were good. Staff were friendly and attentive. | review_rating:4, text:We ordered 3 main dishes and 4 drinks. The quality, presentation and portion of the food is pretty good.

Our mix platter were generally okay. My son love the yogurt sauce and I think he complimented it at least 10 times. Lol. The lamb meat is a little on the tough, chewier side. The kebab is also a little dense. Chicken breast cutlets a little overcooked. Hummus needs more olive oil & I would prefer if you don't spread it so thinly on the plate. By the time it is served it almost dried out. Probably just spread on certain portion of the plate and keep it thicker.

The beef burger (served using a pita bread) is good. My only comment is the sauce used in it taste a little like cheap cheese sauce. Otherwise, the nachos, salad are good. The meat inside is flavorful but still also on the dense side. I think maybe is the same meat mixture as the kebab.

The buffalo wings batter is really crispy. The fries are done so well. Super crispy and well seasoned.

The drinks were all great in taste and presentation.

We love the atmosphere and the service attitude. ♥️ | review_rating:4, text:Good menu variety, very unique fusion of modern mediterranean food. Place is comfortable and bright, and service is good. Loved the nachos and especially that dipping sauce that came with it.
Ordered the falafel wrap because it seemed pretty unique. Taste was great but somehow it didn't sit well with my stomach later on.
We got the free baklava set from signing up and honestly it was not too sweet and just nice. Overall, I'd recommend to still give this place a try. | review_rating:5, text:The shop are beautiful and clean. Apparently, it just opened 4 weeks ago. The waiter mentioned that there are a few other branches. The food is delicious.

It was my first time trying Lebanese coffee. The coffee wasn’t too strong and suited my taste. It also had a hint of cardamom and a slightly spiced flavor.

All the staff were very kind and customer-friendly. The prices of the food were quite reasonable and not too expensive. Worth it. However, the downside is that the internet at the shop was a bit weak, so ordering online was a bit slow and challenging. Hopefully, the management will take note of this.

Now the decor and atmosphere of the restaurant is a close replica of a typical Middle Eastern cafe in the movies unless you have actually travelled there.

The waiting staff is courteous and accommodating.  Furthermore the staff that waited on us was pretty proficient in Mandarin and Hokkien which was a delightful surprise to me and my friend.

Now for the food... What can I say. It was really yummy with the lamb stewed to falling of the bone and the chicken was fork tender. The mix platter kebabs was scrumptious as well with just a minor misharmony with the chicken kebab being a tad dry in this symphony of good food vibes.

The pricing for the food is quite reasonable with each pax coming to approx RM30-40.

From the place I sat I could see the kitchen staff were eating in the kitchen. While another few were standing stay far away from their customers without checking nor having eye contact with the customers. Unfortunately, the table I saw at without the bell.

The herbal noodle soup I ordered is bland and over price. I requested for soya sauce, when delivered that time there is oil inside, make me wonder if the sauce plate unclean or it's recycle. At the end I did not consume.

When I walked in and asked for input on specific product, I needed some opinions on what to get, an older staff simply pointed me to a section without offering any real help and quickly moved on to attend to someone else while also showing a strong attitude.

This old lady that worked there was extremely rude and basically said that there's no shade for my skin tone in their shop in a condescending manner when I entered the store. Mind you, I'm Indian. She was constantly making comments on my skin texture by comparing it to my sister's. It made me feel very insecure.  She was also hesitant to help out. No smile or polite gestures. I left without buying anything because I was so upset. A couple of weeks later I passed by dior again. The same woman was very smiley and inviting to a few Chinese girls who were walking across to enter the branch. Feels very racist. The management should do something about this.

The staff came back later and say because its frozen squid ring, after cooked, the skin becomes like this cause of the bubbles. Really? Like really im supposed to believe that? Or is it a fly laid eggs on it thats why it has those white things? Don’t say they are sesame seed also because they are smaller than that. I’ve asked a chef that has been dealing with frozen squid rings for years, he mentioned he never seen such thing before.

I recently visited a Dunkin' Donuts outlet and was left feeling frustrated and disappointed by the customer service.

When I was deciding on my order, the staff member insisted that I purchase four donuts to receive a box. While I understand the desire to minimize waste, it felt inflexible and inconvenient, especially for a smaller order.

Moreover, the lack of a larger bag to carry the individual paper bags was surprising. It seemed like a minor detail, but it added to the overall inconvenience of the experience.

While Dunkin' Donuts has historically offered boxes for smaller orders, this recent experience suggests a potential downgrade in customer service. It's important to remember that good customer service can significantly impact a customer's overall satisfaction.

I hope that Dunkin' Donuts will take steps to improve their customer service policies and training to ensure a more positive experience for future customers. | review_rating:3, text:Sweet treat is not for me, but I do drop here to pack these colourful, vibrant, attractive and hunger calling donuts.

In 1911, in Biella, a small Italian town near the Alps, the FILA brothers, who were interested in the textile industry, established a knitwear and underwear company, leveraging the town's abundant resources.
Over time, the business expanded by incorporating the artistic color sense unique to Italians into their clothing, laying the foundation for what Fila is today.
Globally known
FILA gained global attention for its instantly recognisable tennis apparel in the 1970s, and has since expanded their design portfolio to include sporting apparel across a wide range of codes including golf, training, running and compression wear.
While their technical processes are at the forefront of sporting design, the brand remains true to its time-honoured European aesthetic and outfits professional artists and athletes from around the world.
A century after its inception, FILA has become synonymous with both sport and sophistication, worn by world-renowned professional athletes as well as fashion-conscious individuals.
Collaborations with luxury fashion houses and influential designers have captured the attention of the fashion world, and the premium lifestyle sports brand continues to make its mark to this day.

It was ok i let it brush out but the simplest thing as a worker in a any store need to be patience right but this girl as if she dont want any customers she straight up says the bill. What the hell?? Without even asking “is there anymore else maam” , not even that she just said this much (to pay) hello i can buy the whole shop if i wanted to do it. There is no manners or whatsoever. Just because i were choosing much more, she removed the glass window (which is normal i understand) but she literally banged that down (glass window) :) i just stared and just start pointing out without speaking because i reallly dont like her and her attitude/manners. Then during payment finish she didnt hand out the cookies instead bang it on the counter. There is a difference of just putting down and slam/bang on it. I can hear that sound of bang. I really lose my shit on there and wanted to scold her. I had endured every stages she has showed me , not necessarily to bang my cookies which I bought in MY MONEY not hers at all. We are the one paying her, if she cannot show a proper service dont work lah. Why are you making yourself a joke to the public. Even you have a major problem in home dont show that in your work place, work place is not a space for you to release your anger especially to your customers.

Highly recommend! | review_rating:4, text:Located within Sunway Pyramid Mall, Formosa is a venerable Taiwanese food stall that has stood the test of time as one of the oldest eateries in this bustling mall. It's a place where Asian comfort food takes center stage, and their Taiwanese Hot Crispy Chicken Rice Set exemplifies this perfectly.

This dish, priced from RM19.50, is a true indulgence. It features crispy, slightly spicy fried chicken served flat out, accompanied by their incredibly flavorful braised sauce and a bed of tofu rice. This combination of textures and flavors is nothing short of addictive.

The Taiwanese Hot Crispy Chicken Rice Set doesn't stop at the chicken alone; it includes a full meal experience. Alongside the crispy chicken, you'll find a serving of braised sauce-topped rice, with the option to add a braised egg, tofu, or both, depending on your preference. To complete the meal, it even comes with a refreshing bubble milk tea.

For those looking to elevate their culinary adventure, an extra plate of Taiwanese sausage is a wise choice. When everything is combined and generously topped with their garlicy chili sambal paste, the flavors harmonize in a symphony of deliciousness that's sure to leave your taste buds dancing.

Formosa has earned its reputation as a go-to spot for students in the area seeking a quick and satisfying lunch or dinner. With its reasonable prices and substantial food portions, it offers a dining experience that's not only delicious but also budget-friendly.",3.8,+60 12-481 0444,"Monday: 10:30 AM – 10:00 PM, Tuesday: 10:30 AM – 10:00 PM, Wednesday: 10:30 AM – 10:00 PM, Thursday: 10:30 AM – 10:00 PM, Friday: 10:30 AM – 10:00 PM, Saturday: 10:30 AM – 10:00 PM, Sunday: 10:30 AM – 10:00 PM"

I purchased a phone case from this shop because my old one was broken. I asked the guy (circled in red) if they had a phone case for the Honor 50. He mentioned that since the Honor 50 is an older model, it was lucky they had one last piece in stock. Trusting his word, I decided to purchase it without asking the price, there was no price tag label on the phone case packaging.

At the counter, he started cleaning my phone screen without asking me first. After that, he charged me RM69 for the phone case—much more than I expected! When I politely asked if there was any discount, he only reduced the price by RM2, bringing it to RM67. I reluctantly paid and left the shop, but after discussing it with my friend, my friend and I felt that the guy ""scammed"" me since similar phone cases are sold on Shopee for RM10-30.

Within an hour, I returned to the shop with the receipt to request a refund. However, the guy refused, saying that once the package is opened, they cannot resell it. I considered reporting this to MDTCA, but the process would take too long. I strongly advise anyone to not visiting this shop. | review_rating:5, text:Good service!

This is the iconic British chef’s inaugural restaurant in Malaysia and the first Gordon Ramsay Bar & Grill outside the United Kingdom.
The restaurant blends Gordon Ramsay’s British heritage with the grace and grandeur of Sunway Resort. A series of luxurious and intimate spaces include a trio of private dining rooms – 8 Mayfair, 10 Soho and 12 Chelsea, a grand dining room with semi-private seating booths and a glittering cocktail bar with floor-to-ceiling windows, seating up to a total of 150 guests at a time.
The interior design features robust furnishings with a rich red and forest green colour scheme accentuated by polished walnut hardwood flooring, brass finishes, 24 karat gold leaf hand-placed ceiling and more. Monochrome portraits of British style icons by celebrated photographers Terry O’Neill and Arthur Steel feature The Rolling Stones frontman Sir Mick Jagger, the original 007 Sir Sean Connery, supermodels Jean Shrimpton and Twiggy, line the walls of the main dining room.
Gordon Ramsay Bar & Grill features an exquisite menu inspired by one of London’s most iconic restaurants, Savoy Grill, showcasing only the finest ingredients presented with culinary flair from the highly skilled, Gordon Ramsay-trained team. Diners can look forward to savouring prime cuts of meat dry-aged in-house and Chef Ramsay’s most desirable dishes, such as his ‘Classic Beef Wellington’, served tableside, the ‘Spiced Beef Tartare with Egg Yolk Confit’, his must-try ‘Arnold Bennett Twice-baked Cheese Soufflé with Mornay Sauce’, the ‘Dover Sole with Grenobloise capers sauce’ and more. For guests looking to wind down in the evenings, take a seat at our bar and sip on concoctions from a masterly crafted menu of classic favourites, cocktails with Malaysian-inspired flavours and a host of premium wines and spirits. Adjacent to the cocktail bar, a dedicated wine cellar showcases an extensive global wine list for wine enthusiasts and a private room welcomes intimate evenings for tastings, social gatherings and more.","Lobby Level, Sunway Resort (Ground Floor)","Lobby Level Sunway Resort, Persiaran Lagoon, Bandar Sunway, 47500 Subang Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia","review_rating:3, text:Gordon Ramsay’s restaurant at Sunway Resort offers a stylish atmosphere and impeccable service, but unfortunately, the food doesn’t quite live up to the premium price tag. While the dishes are well-presented and the flavors are decent, they don’t offer the bold, unforgettable taste one might expect from a Michelin-starred chef. For the price, the portion sizes feel a bit lacking, leaving it hard to justify the value for money. A nice experience for those looking to try a celebrity chef’s restaurant, but there are better options for the price in KL. | review_rating:5, text:My husband and I had a delightful afternoon tea here on Valentine’s Day, and it was an experience to remember. From the moment we arrived, the staff were incredibly warm, professional, and attentive, ensuring we felt welcomed and well taken care of.

The ambience was elegant yet cosy, creating the perfect setting for a relaxing afternoon. To make the occasion even more special, a live violinist performed romantic melodies, adding a beautiful touch to the atmosphere.

The afternoon tea selection was beautifully presented, featuring a wonderful assortment of freshly made pastries, sandwiches, and fine teas. One of the highlights was Gordon’s signature Beef Wellington, which was cooked to perfection—crispy on the outside, tender and flavorful on the inside. Every dish was crafted with high-quality ingredients and impeccable attention to detail.

Despite the exceptional quality of the food and service, the price was quite reasonable, making it a great value for the experience provided. Everything from the service to the ambience exceeded our expectations. It was a truly enjoyable and romantic afternoon, and we would highly recommend this place for anyone looking for an elegant yet affordable afternoon tea experience. We will definitely be returning! | review_rating:5, text:My husband and I had the most unforgettable birthday celebration here. From the moment we walked in, I was in awe of the stunning interior decor and the exceptional, five-star service. Anthony, who served us, and all the staff went above and beyond to make the evening feel truly special. They even surprised us with a beautiful card and a complimentary non-alcoholic gin and tonic, which added a thoughtful touch to the experience. Thanks a lot Anthony for your superb service and everyone there!

As fans of Gordon Ramsay, dining at his restaurant was a thrill, especially seeing a photo of the celebrity chef himself on the wall! Our three-course meal was incredible, every dish worth every penny. For any Ramsay fan, this place is a must-visit, perfect for a memorable celebration.

We can’t wait to return to explore more of the menu and perhaps indulge in their afternoon tea. Highly recommended! | review_rating:4, text:Celebrated a special occasion here and it was a very enjoyable experience with good food on the whole and even better service. We arrived earlier for pre-dinner drinks at the bar and the cocktails were exceptional - among the best we've had in Malaysia and definitely a strong start to the evening. A surprising menu highlight was the Bone Marrow (beef tartare) which was excellent. Signature dishes (Beef Wellington, Arnold Bennett Souffle, Apple Tarte Tartin) did not disappoint. Only underwhelming dish was probably the Black Cod which we found underseasoned and lacking in flavor. Extensive wine list even by the glass. All in all a great place to go for an evening to remember. | review_rating:5, text:I recently dined at Gordon Ramsay Bar & Grill in Sunway City, Kuala Lumpur to celebrate my wife’s birthday, and it was an unforgettable experience that truly lived up to its renowned reputation.

Food:
The food was nothing short of perfection. The Bar & Grill Burger was a standout, bursting with flavour and crafted to absolute perfection. The Grilled Miso Salmon was another highlight, with its rich, umami flavors and tender texture. To top it all off, the Blackberry Parfait was a dessert masterpiece, refreshing, indulgent, and the perfect ending to an incredible meal. Each dish was thoughtfully prepared and presented with finesse.

Drinks:
The drinks selection was outstanding, featuring a carefully curated range of beverages to complement the exquisite dishes. Whether you prefer a fine selection or something refreshing, the options are tailored to enhance the overall dining experience.

Service:
The service was impeccable. The staff were attentive, friendly, and ensured we had everything we needed for a special evening. They went above and beyond to make my wife’s birthday celebration memorable.

Important Notes:
1. If you make an online reservation, the payment made during booking will be deducted from your final bill, a seamless and convenient process.

2. For Muslim diners, the restaurant offers a ‘Halal’ dietary exception option when making reservations, showcasing their thoughtful consideration for all guests.

Overall, Gordon Ramsay Bar & Grill offers a fantastic dining experience with exceptional food, drinks, and service. Highly recommended for special occasions or anyone looking to indulge in fine dining!",4.2,+60 3-7495 1572,"Monday: 7:00 AM – 11:00 PM, Tuesday: 7:00 AM – 11:00 PM, Wednesday: 7:00 AM – 11:00 PM, Thursday: 7:00 AM – 11:00 PM, Friday: 7:00 AM – 11:00 PM, Saturday: 7:00 AM – 11:00 PM, Sunday: 7:00 AM – 11:00 PM"

•	Food Haven: Offers an extensive selection of dining options from fast food to upscale restaurants. For Indian food you can try Mantra Restaurant (Not great but decent)
•	Convenient Layout: Despite its size, the mall is well-organized, making navigation easy.
•	Themed Decor: The Egyptian-inspired architecture adds a unique charm, making every visit memorable.

The adjustment was done on the day and I’ve tried it as well.

They say engraving have to wait till the next day 12pm only can be done, on Sunday I called them they said the ring can be done before 2pm. Unfortunately at 1pm when I’m on my way to Sunway Pyramid I received a call from them, said that the engraving can only be done after 4pm. So I’m not able to collect it on Sunday because I don’t want to waste my time waiting there.

Today 1 October Tuesday, I went to collect my ring but the condition is bad, the surface of the ring is scratched. What I’m angry the most is the staff no inform me at the phone about this until I go and collect it they also didn’t mention about anything to me until I saw the scratches on the ring. I asked them why is it like this. Their answer is this can only be fixed at Hong Kong in 2-3 months time. I send a good condition ring over but received a scratched ring? The staff didn’t mention anything about before I ask. The staff should have realise this issue before hand and inform customer and give customer solution to solve this. When the staff handover to me, she just said, the ring is done adjustment and engraving please check, they didn’t even admit they are sorry for scratched the ring and how they can solve it until I ask them. And the scratches are on top of the ring I don’t believe no one else has seen it.

This kind of customer service attitude are bad because it’s not about how far I came to collect it or am I urgently need to use the ring. We bought the marriage ring to wear it not just to use it. It Is the customer expectation to collect a beautiful fit ring from the shop.

I rather have a small pizza full of good toppings than a big one with sparsely scattered toppings. Also with such big size pizza, you can't even try other things.

There's no place to wash your hands. I have to use the mall's toilet. I thought pizza is supposed to be eaten by hand? Street pizza right?

Fortunately, the service staff are good. | review_rating:5, text:Good service and good food. We ordered bottomless pizza and drinks, can unlimited until your full.

My mum called her and queried about the artwork and would like a replacement as she was not happy with it, but the girl say that she can buy a new one instead and deny digital art work by saying 'oh is there is such a thing?' to the word 'digital art'. Sounds very dodgy and would not recommend her unless she is drawing in front of you or made it clear 100% hand drawn.

After some time, I noticed that she reopened the counter and served another customer instead of inviting me back.

The way they cook it is fantastic, and it keeps me coming back. Unfortunately, on my recent visit, the pork intestine was unavailable, which was disappointing. I enjoy both the baby spicy and original flavors, but I prefer the original with extra garlic. However, this time, the garlic tasted off—almost spoiled, which was a letdown.

The soup has been consistently good since my first visit, and it didn’t disappoint this time either. I also tried the cheese mantou today. While the exterior was crispy and nice, the cheese filling had a strange low-quality plastic container smell, and when eaten together, it tasted slightly sour. It wasn’t a pleasant experience.

Unfortunately, the dry hotpot here isn’t great at all👎👎. It’s too bland, just plain spicy and lack of good flavor (i don’t know why they wana add cumin flavor into it cos it’s actually meant for chinese bbq but they added this into dry hotpot which made it really weird). Nevertheless, the mala soup actually tastes really good 👍(but you get the same flavour from Master Kang instant noodles🤣) .

Another thing that put me off  is the so-called member price. It’s free to join then you get discount, but why bother to require that when you already allow everyone join for free. Wasting time and just finding excuse to charge more. Price actually is quite reasonable though. But overall i won’t go back to this brand outlets again. 😅

Finally reminder, when you select the pork or beef, it is usually rolled up so it’s easy to clip, MAKE SURE you tell the counter that you don’t want it to be cut into smaller pieces, my pork belly roll mysteriously ended up as 2 small pieces only 😹.

Haagen Dazs founder, Reuben believed that if you were going to indulge in ice cream, it should be a real and fulfilling experience rather than the 'cold and sweet stuff' of his time. Häagen-Dazs ice cream comes in several traditional flavors as well as several esoteric flavors that are specific to the brand, such as Vanilla Swiss Almond and Bananas Foster. It is marketed as a ""super-premium"" brand: it is quite dense means it is very little air is mixed in during manufacture, uses no emulsifiers or stabilizers other than egg yolks, and has a high butterfat content. It is sold both in grocery stores and in dedicated retail outlets serving ice cream cones, sundaes, and so on. Häagen-Dazs ice cream starts with real cream and milk, which we then blend with carefully selected ingredients, to create an ice cream with a unique velvety texture and unforgettable taste.

•	Convenient Layout: Despite its size, the mall is well-organized, making navigation easy.

Trust us when we say that at Havaianas at Sunway Pyramid, you’ll find only the trendiest and comfortable pairs that look so great you’ll want to wear it everywhere. What was previously worn as an essential beachwear, has now become an icon of fun, fashion and casualness that will accompany you no matter how far your feet take you. With over 50 years of history in the footwear retailer industry, this Brazilian brand’s first pair was actually based on the traditional Japanese Zori sandals which use rice straw to create the soles. How the brand makes its flit flops and sandals iconic is by it trademark design, creating the texture of their rubber soles to appear like rice grains. Even before crossing international borders, the brand first gained recognition from foreign countries when tourists would love to them home as gifts, or even to sell in their home country. Havaianas’ footwear isn’t just iconic, it gives you top quality to match its reputation, claiming that their flit flops and sandals don’t lose their shape, don’t smell and their straps don’t come loose. Over the years, the brand has evolved and adapted with trends, which led to the birth of new footwear from them, including sneakers and espadrilles to cater to fans who live in countries with climates that require something warmer than flit flops. Translating the rubber flit flops into the soles of the sneaker showcases how the brand retains its symbolic feature into its latest creations. Havaianas constantly brings you fresh designs featuring eye-catching colours, fun prints, and even special collections (like their Frozen 2 range!).

However, the broth could use a bit more kick—the spice level was milder than expected and didn't quite hit the mark.

The environment was comfortable, not too hot or too cold, which was nice. I ordered the lunch set, but it required an additional RM3 for an iced lemon tea, which felt a bit off since you'd expect the set to be a better value without add-ons.

The service was okay, though sometimes it took a while to get the staff's attention as they didn’t always check for raised hands.

Ramen also slightly pricey to compare with big bowl but normal portion (at least to us lah). Ramen soup also ok-lah just like that. AND do not add on extra chilli.

The atmosphere as per exhibited by the waitress was bordeline hostile.

Question:

1. Is it the SOP that takeaway customers are not allowed to be seated in order to view the menu & make the selection?

The restaurant was only a handful of customers since it was after lunch hour (1521 hours). Thus, there are a lot of empty tables. In addition, there were no customer queuing anyway.

2. Is it the SOP that takeaway customers is warranted to wait outside of the restaurant while awaiting for the meal to be ready?

It really baffles me that I was not allowed to be seated because I have chose to takeway my meals.

The waitress in a way insisted me to wait outside for my meal, whereas, I have ordered 2 drinks for dine-in (the drinks were noted as takeaway in the receipt, even though I have stated otherwise).

If not because of one (1) of the waiter (a gentleman), I would have to stand outside while waiting for my meal.

3. Is it the SOP as well for the customer to clear the table from the drinks which were consumed as dine-in?
(As aforementioned, the drinks were packed as takeaway, whereas I had it ordered as dine-in).

This is my 1st & final visit to Johnny's (Sunway Pyramid's branch). | review_rating:2, text:The service was mediocre at best, there's a stupid robot waiter with songs playing like its necessary to have it.

Enjoy Jollibee's bestsellers such as the world-famous Chickenjoy - delicately hand-breaded for a crispy exterior, cooked with precision for maximum juiciness, and marinated to the bone for next-level flavour. For those who love a hot kick to their fried chicken, Jollibee offers Spicy Chickenjoy which is coated with fiery breading and infused with a signature spicy marinade. Some of the other crowd pleasers includes the Jolly Spaghetti, prepared with its signature sweet-style sauce, loaded with chunky slices of beef sausage and generously topped with cheese, and the Yumburger is Jollibee’s version of the hamburger and a favourite that can be ordered with or without cheese.",LG2.126A (Lower Ground 2 Floor),"Lot LG2.126A, Lower Ground 2, Blue Atrium, Sunway Pyramid Mall, Jalan PJS 11/15, Bandar Sunway, 46150 Petaling Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia","review_rating:4, text:Came by for a quick late lunch since there was almost no queue at the ordering kiosks. The orders were quickly fulfilled via a numbered ticket on your order receipt.

Taste wise, biting into either their fried chicken or beef burgers is quite nostalgic if you have had their offerings from childhood. It still tastes pretty decent and some of the menu options on display do reflect the pinoy influence on the menu options here. All in all, a decent alternative to the competition at the Golden Arches and other similar outlets. Oh, and they have Mountain Dew. Recommended if you've never tried this or used to enjoy their offerings as a kid. | review_rating:5, text:First time tried Jollibees. Love it. Fried chickens taste different from others franchise. Like the sweetness of the spaghetti (suit for my kid). Kinda fond with pineapple juice to cleanse the taste after the meal. Mashed potatoes not too soft and the gravy not thick which I preferred thick. Coleslaw fresh and sweet. Unfortunately service kinda slow. | review_rating:2, text:This isn't my first visit here, but my most recent visit left me dissappointed with the food. I ordered the Burger steak thay comes with a rice and a burger patty. Needless to say, check out my photo to see how depressing that burger patty looks. I had to hold it up with a fork to take this photo or else its so thin that it sinks beneath the sauce. The taste was ok, but portion was really not worth the money.
The only saving grace was the peach mango pie which has been my all-time favourite.
Will I be back? Maybe, but I would go for the Jolly spaghetti or chicken next time. | review_rating:4, text:My first time trying Jollibee yesterday. I ordered a set which had 1 piece of chicken, a burger, spagetti and a drink. And I added an ala carte hotdog so that I get to try a wide range of their food.
The burger was relatively small in size but the taste of the burger meat was pretty nice, compared to other fast food burgers. It had a pleasant distinct smoky flavour.
Am happy they had spagetti because I love spagetti.
The special thing about their fried chicken was their brown sauce which had herb taste in it. And the chicken seasoning was nice too.
The sausage in the hot dog tasted good too - it had a unique smoky taste to it too. The BBQ sauce was a tad too sweet and overpowering.
A bit disappointed their drink was not re-fillable.

A shout out to the sweet server staff who help bring the whole lot of food to my table instead having me go collect to food fm the counter myself. | review_rating:2, text:It is very disappointing that rice and chicken together only got very small portion of gravy, cannot add on extra gravy also, the cleanliness of the seat also quite bad, need to self service to clean up the table and eat.

But the service here is lackluster, like what most reviews have said. The cashier was a foriegn worker and I didn't know what he was mumbling.
Most tables are left dirty and not cleaned. The rubbish bin looks disgusting. | review_rating:1, text:I’ve always wanted to try Juicy ever since I started using Shopee e-vouchers. Today, I finally gave it a shot and ordered an Avocado drink since it was on sale for just RM8. While it was tasty and decent for the price, I don’t think it quite met the standard of a full-priced RM12.90 drink.

What really let me down, however, was the cashier’s attitude during my visit. As a first-timer at Juicy, I was hoping for a little guidance, but the female staff didn’t bother explaining the avocado drink options on the menu. Instead, she abruptly asked, “Avocado apa?” without pointing out the choices from the start. After I paid, she handed me the receipt without a word of thanks. Even though I said “thank you” to her, she didn’t smile or acknowledge it—her expression clearly showed she didn’t want to be there.

The lack of professionalism became even more apparent when the next customer (as seen in the photo) pointed out a mistake in their order. Rather than apologising and fixing the drink, the staff exchanged annoyed glances with each other. Based on this experience and previous Google reviews, it’s obvious that the staff could use serious training in customer service and might not be suited for Front-of-House roles in F&B. | review_rating:5, text:Have always love the juices here.

They were whispering when I approached. I am a frequent visitor at sunway pyramid but I realised that this only happens at your shop and I have noticed this multiple times prior to this occasion also. I understand everyone wants to finish  and close up to go back home but 9:20 it’s seems ridiculous. Even after my turn there were 3 more group of customers and the main cashier’s attitude was the same. What’s weird is that the cashier and the other worker seem to be giggling with each other but when serving customers they seemed like they just couldn’t care. I am not asking for much, just at least pretend to be interested if you’re in the service industry.

If I lived here, I would take a few months to even fully explore the place, much less try out all of the stores. Pretty fun, lots to eat and shop, so honestly it's worth living nearby. Food isn't very pricey so that's also a plus. | review_rating:4, text:As a frequent visitor, here’s my take on Sunway Pyramid:
•	Diverse Shopping: With a wide array of shops, it caters to all family members, from fashion to gadgets.
•	Family-Friendly Activities: The mall features an indoor ice-skating rink and a massive arcade that are perfect for kids and adults alike. My daughter loves to play at Parenthood. They have upgraded it too recently and we enjoyed it.
•	Food Haven: Offers an extensive selection of dining options from fast food to upscale restaurants. For Indian food you can try Mantra Restaurant (Not great but decent)
•	Convenient Layout: Despite its size, the mall is well-organized, making navigation easy.
•	Themed Decor: The Egyptian-inspired architecture adds a unique charm, making every visit memorable.

I was afraid I had misunderstood her and even double-checked with her to see if the dress I was looking at could be tried on, and she did not disappoint me. She said the dress didn't fit me. I asked if the customer insisted on trying it on, couldn't she do that too?
She replied in a very firm tone: ""Yes, you can't.""

She knows her stuff well and offered suitable size for me to try on, and even helped tidying up my dress after I had put it on, checked with me if she tied the waist too tight, and even offered a heel for me to wear for the long dress I tried.

Initially I got a smaller size for the first piece, she had a look on my size and offer me a bigger pieces.
Next when I wanna try the second piece, she offer me a smaller size and told me that the cutting is much bigger, so advice me to try the size first, if I needed a bigger size, then I can let her know.

This is exactly the service we need to get whenever we’re in fashion shop. Not some representative who just stand there and following us only.

We ordered the healthy drink Power size with #myDigi app promotion. The staff poured the drink to the Power size cup and it wasn't full so she added a cup of ice and blended again to pour it into the cup to make it full. We drank it and it was too bland and tasteless. We nicely feedback to the staffs and the replies we got was it's bland because it's health drink without yogurt in it and both the staffs keep insisting that's the reason the juice got bland. We then told them that they have added so much ice into it and they kept insisting they only add in half cup of ice which we saw there are a total of 2 full cup of ice (before blended the first round and 2nd round another cup). They didn't want to take responsibility for it and just simply give reasons to shoo us away instead of helping the paying customers. We then went to the cashier to tell the cashier thinking she might be the person who could at least solve the problem but she just acted blur and turned away. The staffs also asked us to move away and not blocking the cashier for other customers to make payment which then there were no customers behind us. This is SUPER RUDE. One of the staff then get our drink and then asked to pour away the ice but it was blended and we wonder how she would do that to pour away the ice? We saw her just pour the drink out to the blender and pour some juice away into the sink then pour back into the cup. And guess what the content becomes even lesser and the TASTE IS STILL BLAND. The staffs are trying to CHEAT on customers CONSTANTLY. We were so tired of their NONSENSE.

Krispy Kreme Malaysia 🇲🇾 has come up with 3 superb flavours in conjunction of the Ramadan month 🌙. So we managed to try the ..
-Ketayap 🍩. Based on the local snack “kuih ketayap” which is stuffed with sweetened coconut filling and pandan juice . So yeaaa.. the sweetness does replicate the pandan and the coconut 🥥 filling was a great addition.

-Eid Ketupat🍩. Based on Ketupat prints , which is rice packed inside a diamond-shaped container of woven palm leaf pouch.
The outer layer is colour icing sugar and the inside is a custard cream ... superb bonus 😋

-Almond London🍩. Based on local famous chocolate almond cookies. It has a coat of chocolate 🍫, topped with biscuit and almond crumbles. This is our least favourite among all.

-Double chocolate 🍩. Well this is one of the favourite of all time , Chocolate toppings and chocolate filling 🍫🍫🤟. That’s a double hit combo !!

Happy Friday!!!

Kwan Kee Store, a Michelin-recognized spot, is a must-visit for those who appreciate traditional Hong Kong pastries. Their dedication to authentic flavors and quality ingredients is evident in their offerings.

The white sugar sponge cake stands out with its light, fluffy texture and just the right level of sweetness—perfect for those who prefer a more delicate taste. The steamed red bean cake and pandan cake are also excellent, packed with red beans and maintaining a balanced, natural flavor without being overly sweet.

However, the Musang King rice roll falls a bit short. While the concept is interesting, it lacks the strong durian fragrance that one might expect from Musang King, leaving room for improvement in flavor intensity.

In fact the male associate actually pointed at the cheaper one saying the design of it would probably be more to the liking of an older gentleman. The display wallet was the last one so they couldn’t give me a new one, but polished the display one up for me, and also let me know that they offered lifetime polishing for the particular brand of wallet that I purchased, Charles Berkeley, my dad just needed to stop by any Leather Avenue outlet.

Limapulo by Baba Can Cook, was founded by the late John Tan Kim Chye (affectionately
known as Uncle John) and Alan Yun in 2014. Uncle John, a Baba, was the eldest son and
guardian of his family recipes. This is unusual as the kitchen was the domain of the
Nyonyas.
Alan and Uncle John both believe that the best way to preserve Peranakan heritage recipes
is by sharing them with the world.
Peranakan cuisine is a marriage of Hokkien flavours of soy and bean paste with the Malay
flavours of spice, coconut and tamarind. Dishes are labour intensive and elaborate, an
indicator of the wealth of the Peranakans.",G1.PT.05 & 06 (Ground Floor),"3, Jalan PJS 11/15, Bandar Sunway, 47500 Petaling Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia","review_rating:5, text:Very large.

•	Diverse Shopping: With a wide array of shops, it caters to all family members, from fashion to gadgets.
•	Family-Friendly Activities: The mall features an indoor ice-skating rink and a massive arcade that are perfect for kids and adults alike. My daughter loves to play at Parenthood. They have upgraded it too recently and we enjoyed it.
•	Food Haven: Offers an extensive selection of dining options from fast food to upscale restaurants. For Indian food you can try Mantra Restaurant (Not great but decent)
•	Convenient Layout: Despite its size, the mall is well-organized, making navigation easy.
•	Themed Decor: The Egyptian-inspired architecture adds a unique charm, making every visit memorable.

Wow it was Luckin Coffee the popular n famous brand of coffee from China. But why the large crowd? We discovered that they were having a promotion. Only RM 2.99 per cup of coffee of your choice from their menu. They offer a wide variety of coffees which range from RM 10 _ RM 15. So cheap n highly affordable. So we also joined the queue. The workers worked very fast n were very efficient in preparing the coffee. We didn't need to wait long before we got our coffee. They were very orderly n systematic in their operation too. First we had to scan the QR code n then download the app n then register n then choose your coffee n then you make your payment.

It was around 5pm at that time, so the cafe was not that busy as it was past tea time for most of the shoppers. So the tables n chairs around this cafe were almost empty except for one or two customers buying some drinks. Anyway , the shelves where  all the pastries n cakes were displayed , were almost empty. So many of their pastries were already sold out. There were a wide range of different types of drinks such as coffee n drinks on sale. Browsing through the pastries, I chose to buy some pastries to take back home as breakfast the next morning. What I bought was some pastries such as 3 croissants, 2 fruit tarts n 4 slices of cheese cakes, lemon cakes n some slices of fruit cakes. | review_rating:5, text:📍Located on the west side of Sunway G floor, next to Bobbie Brown.

🍰Coffee Basque cheesecake is really good.
Delicious! Very smooth creamy taste, the wet paste I like! No need to chew, it melts in your mouth~ The coffee flavor is super strong, plus enough cream cheese, it's delicious! The sweetness is just right. Recommended!

☕️Hot latte was ok.

🎬2025.2.1 | review_rating:3, text:So happy that Lizzie is now in Sunway Pyramid! 🙌 A sister cafe of Lisette's, it offers an extensive array of pastries and cakes, as well as grab & go meals. A 10% discount is applicable to Sunway students and employees too.

Currently an opening promotion is going on which you can redeem a free coffee by any purchase of 2 items! 🌟

Ordered:
Pandan Gula Melaka Cake 🍰 (RM17)
Looks visually appealing, but the taste was really meh; it had a super strong pandan fragrance which overpowered the cake ☹️ the texture was also dry, seemed like it may have been refrigerated overnight so it didn't taste as ""fresh"" so there's a mushy mouthfeel. Honestly, could have opted for other cakes instead within a similar price range.

Crookie 🥐 (RM13)
Lizzie's best seller - croissant and soft cookie in one with a thin layer of chocolate spread inside! Not mindblowing, but the standpoint was the croissant, which retained its flakiness throughout; texture isn't soggy too 👍 Not a must try, but it's worth trying if you would like to have a dessert-pastry fusion!

Iced Latte ☕️⭐️ (RM13)
Got this for free as a promotion! Serving cup is bigger than most cafes I have been to so honestly this is reasonable according to price point 😬

Personally visited the first outlet in NU Sentral and my experience was better, probably due to the items I have personally tried. Ambiance wise, the interior is more spacious than the current outlet, plus it's also easier to find seats compared to the current one.

Though Lizzie has both hits and misses, I might return to this outlet again (maybe) to try out some other pastries. | review_rating:2, text:Besides the nice setup here, I've nothing much to say about this cafe.

I recently visited this shop to buy chicken coin and had an extremely disappointing experience. I paid RM 12.25 using my debit card, and I received an SMS confirmation of the transaction. Additionally, the charge was reflected in my bank account. Despite having proof of payment, the staff insisted that I pay again, claiming they did not receive the payment.

When I refused to pay a second time, the situation escalated quickly. The staff member became visibly angry and started throwing the debit machine around, creating a very hostile and uncomfortable environment. Their behavior was completely unprofessional and showed a total lack of respect for customers.

I was shocked by the poor service and the aggressive reaction of the staff. This kind of treatment is unacceptable, and I will definitely not be returning to this shop.

Ordered a Claypot Thai Milk Coffee.

Was so looking forward to an ""immersive tasting experience"". Unfortunately, none at all! Neither was there any touted ""exotic aroma"" nor ""intricate flavours"". Coffee was mediocre -- lacked strength and richness. Disappointed!

Also ordered Pak Lung's Roti Bakar. Pandan was good - smooth, rich, creamy and fragrant. But roti bakar was squashed as if someone had squeezed it and wasn't well toasted.

Nevertheless, splendid location with good vantage point to watch the world go by. Good pitstop to take a break from shopping. | review_rating:4, text:The aroma is very nice when you are near the shop.
I like their menu choices, habe tried the thai milk tea and butterfly pea milk. Both refreshing and smells very nice.
Only downside is that its way too sweet for me. | review_rating:5, text:Opening Promotion till 11/11/24, buy 2 free 1.

Excellent coffee with a unique flavor where it is fused with Pandan leaves.

The atmosphere is great and comfy.. eventhough there is only 7 table at this shop.. to stop and take a stop is great here.. have your coffee or teatime here..

Currently the menu that i LOVE is Claypot Thai Tea Milk, Claypot Thai Tea Coffee, Claypot Thai Cocoa, Claypot Thai Horkasai, Thai Lemon Tea and Last But Not Least Thai Claypot Thai Green Milk Tea.. The Price is reasonable to upgrade only Add On RM1.. The packaging itself is nice and engaging..

It take very long time for them to serve. Second point is the Asam fish head not fresh for the fish head. Got one smell, and the fish got a lot of scale. The only the I feel is nice is the coconut rice smells good and taste delicious. This is the thing you can try.
Overall this visit is unpleasant. Cause other table already serving and we keep waiting almost 40/45 mins. We order around 9 dishes, yet nothing come first. Till we complain with the waiter only one of the ladies apologise. In the end there is a guy waiter who see us very unhappy and provide us the desert cendol.

We had dumpling soup, glass noodles with soft shell crab and otak-otak fried rice.

The dumpling soup is a delightful blend of flavours and textures. The minced prawn and chicken filling in the dumplings is succulent and well seasoned, providing a savoury bite with each spoonful. The broth is light yet flavourful, perfectly complementing the dumplings.

The claypot glass noodles with soft shell crab is a dish that truly standout. The glass noodles are stir fried in dark soy sauce, giving them a rich and umami flavour. The highlight, of course, is the soft shell crab, which is cooked to perfection. The crab is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, adding a delightful crunch to the dish. The combination of textures and flavours makes this a must try.

Lastly, the otak-otak fried rice is a unique and flavourful dish. The rice is perfectly cooked and infused with the distinct taste of otak-otak, a special fish cake. The dish is well balanced and not overly spicy, making it enjoyable for a wide range of palates. It’s a creative twist on traditional fried rice that is sure to impress. | review_rating:5, text:You must dine at Madam Kwan’s at Sunway Pyramid. The Satay is the best i have tasted in my lifetime!

We just had to order a second plate of the Salted Fish Fried Rice ! The Nasi Bojari is also the best so far. These dishes were recommended by their staff Ika who is very  friendly and her customer service is unparalleled!  We ended our meal with another recommendation by Ika - Fritters with Ice Cream.

I reminded him that the other parcels mentioned in the previous messages had already been collected and that he only needed to check the last message.

He spoke to me in an unfriendly manner and asked, ""Parcel bila sampai?"" That was when I finally understood his question. I informed him that the parcel had just arrived today. However, at the end, he said to me in a blaming tone, ""Lain kali bagi tahu parcel bila sampai, sini parcel banyak.""

Another staff member (Kakak with glasses) kindly explained to me that, because they have so many parcels, they usually categorize them by the received date.

I understand the workload, but I must say this:

Normally, I drop my parcels at the Mentari branch, but since that branch was full, I decided to use this branch instead. However, I will never drop my parcels here again.

It's colorful and pretty looking. That's what gets me all the time. What's more, it's Manuka Honey and not the pure sugar that is making it sweet.

But the drinks do suit my taste buds. | review_rating:5, text:As a fan of health-conscious beverages, I recently tried Manuka honey drink, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations in both taste and nutritional benefits.

Firstly, let's talk about the flavor. Manuka honey drink offers a delightful blend of sweetness from the honey with a subtle hint of earthiness. The richness of the honey provides a comforting warmth to each sip, making it a truly enjoyable experience.

Beyond its taste, the health benefits of Manuka honey are well-documented. Renowned for its antibacterial properties, Manuka honey is believed to support immune health and promote overall well-being. Knowing that each sip of this delicious beverage may contribute to my health gives me even more reason to indulge.

What I appreciate most about Manuka honey drink is its versatility. Whether enjoyed hot as a soothing beverage on a chilly day or chilled for a refreshing pick-me-up, it never fails to satisfy my cravings for something both healthy and delicious.

In conclusion, Manuka honey drink has earned its place as a staple in my beverage repertoire. Its delectable flavor and potential health benefits make it a standout choice for anyone looking to elevate their drinking experience. I highly recommend giving it a try – your taste buds and your body will thank you. | review_rating:5, text:Just nice packing and very gentle staff.

•	Food Haven: Offers an extensive selection of dining options from fast food to upscale restaurants. For Indian food you can try Mantra Restaurant (Not great but decent)
•	Convenient Layout: Despite its size, the mall is well-organized, making navigation easy.
•	Themed Decor: The Egyptian-inspired architecture adds a unique charm, making every visit memorable.

Speaking of the staff, Elisha and Ken were fantastic,both were super helpful and polite throughout. Whenever we got stuck, they provided just the right amount of micro clues, letting us figure things out without spoiling the puzzles. I really appreciated that.

Monobo, with its foamy PVC-EVA heel and girly, glittery designs, is another alternative to other brands of jelly shoes in the market.
Jelly shoes are shoes made of PVC plastic. Its name refers to the semi-transparent materials with a jelly-like sheen. The shoes became a fad in the mid-1980s. Like many other fashion trends from the 1980s, jelly shoes have been revived a number of times since the late 1990s, because they are so wearable and stylish. In fact, jelly shoes are so comfortable and versatile that celebrities with vastly different styles like Katy Perry, Anne Hathaway, Rihanna and even the First Lady Michelle Obama have been seen sporting them in their downtime!
Whether you’re into flats, wedge heels, or even loafers, Monobo offers comfy options that can be easily paired with a flare dress or capri pants for a weekend jaunt into town, or a blouse and pencil skirt combo for a dressier, pulled together look.

I ordered a soya bean curd with taro ball add-on, which cost RM3 extra, but it only came with 4 mini taro balls. This was shocking, so I questioned the cashier. They added 2 more mini taro balls, but it still felt like very poor value for money.

Additionally, the soya bean curd itself lacked the rich, authentic soya taste I was expecting. It was bland and did not meet the standard I’ve experienced at other similar shops.

Overall, this was not a good experience for the price I paid, and I hope the shop can improve its quality and portion sizes. | review_rating:4, text:No, this Mr Bean has nothing to do with Mr Bean the classic comedy series. Yes, it is yet another dessert chain outlet that serves overpriced artisan Tau Fu Fah.

I've nothing against such outlets as it is good that the traditional dessert is enjoying a sudden resurgence of late. However, Tau Fu Fah is a rather simple dessert and I've always found it difficult to swallow the sky-high prices.

Prices aside, the Tau Fu Fah here is smooth and creamy, just the way I like it. It is nice that customers have options on the type of sugar and the sugar level but on the other hand be prepared to pay up to RM2 more for some of the sugar options. Ironically, you don't get a discount if you opt for just 25% sugar level.

Besides the soya items, they also serve Japanese Pancakes with a variety of both sweet and savory fillings.

Curious about why would anyone purchase insoles, he began to journey to understand more on shoes and leg pain problems. During abroad, he obtained the principle of bio-dynamics, helping him to further understand insoles and their purpose. He began trying different insoles on himself.
After 6 months, he realized that his own knee problems have improved. Since then, he decided to venture into the making of insole business – MyFeet. He imported digital scanning machines from Korea to analyse customers feet problems and custom made insoles that solve their feet problems. After many years of analysing, feet problems can be categorized into a flat arch, high arch, bowleg, knock knee, overpronation, and supination. These problems will lead to an imbalance of body biodynamics, causing stress on the rest of the body such as foot pain, knee pain, and back pain.
Mr. Wong created MyFeet to help more people to solve pains caused by the feet. The sandals in MyFeet Sunway Pyramid are carefully engineered using the finest materials like high-grade memory foam, shaped and moulded to fit each wearer feet condition.

The outlet in Sunway Pyramid says they don't repair anymore. I took to the roadside cobbler, he told me MyFeet sandals he can't glue as he has experience glueing them and a week later customer brought back to him after it came off again.
Now I don't know where to send for repairs as this is a new sandals that cost RM299. I hope MyFeet can advise.

Straight to the point we ordered their famous wanton noodles and butter buns and they were out of this world.

Their other food items like we ordered such as Luncheon meat noodles and rice , and yam bun were okay at best but still acceptable as they tasted very fresh and weren't too salty which means the limited usage of MSG which is a positive in my books 👍🏻

However, the reason why I'm rating it a 4 star is the delay of the food arrival as I understand there are a lot of customers but the kitchen staff should combat this and push dishes out quicker.

Environment wise, the cafe is very clean and has a vibrant decor which makes it welcoming for potential customers. There is an open window area on the side for people to look outside and embrace the nature where you can even see Sunway University in the distance.

This service is the worst service you can imagine, it's literally STEALING from customers! HOW can clients be charged so much for such poor service!
I asked for a basic manicure for 48RM, I was far from imagining that this only included nail trimming, no foot soaking, no cleaning, no filing of heels! absolutely nothing, just cut nails, file nails! when I asked the lady who did the pedicure if my feet should not be filed and if it was included in the pedicure, she told me yes but that my heels are hard, so she recommends the medical pedicure (88 RM) rather than the basic one! I thought it would be better, it was worse! She attacked the skin on my feet without wetting them or cleaning them, she just put a tiny bit of emollient product for the heels which she left on for less than 2 minutes, that's all, and she removed the calluses using a special blade. No scrub, no wash, no mask, no massage, no filing, in 15-20 minutes everything was finished and the cashier charged me for 2 pedicures! I paid for 136 RM for just cutting my nails, buffing them a little bit and cutting the callus wich is a scandal! It’s not about money, it’s a question of principles, and it was extremely disappointing!

The cosmetics line began with twelve lipsticks sold at Barneys New York. Since then, NARS has created various multi-use beauty products and now is a subsidiary of Shiseido. After the falling out in the contract with YSL, Shiseido's investment upon merging with NARS in research and development led to the wide range or products for both Females and Males. The company's aim is to create products that suit all genders without discrimination. Evident in the recent collections of palettes, the main darker shades centered around Blue, Gray etc represent the compatibility with males. After taking on YouTuber Jeffree Star's comments on unity in strength amongst all genders, NARS Cosmetics decided to expand their horizon in various designs and color schemes to accommodate all people of color, shapes and sizes who are expressing themselves through makeup. Nars is no longer a cruelty free brand. In 2017 NARS announced that, despite being against animal testing, it was a requirement for selling products in the China market. In a public statement the company said: ""We have decided to make NARS available in China because we feel it is important to bring our vision of beauty and artistry to fans in the region. NARS does not test on animals or ask others to do so on our behalf, except where required by law.""

I've struggled finding the right size that was comfortable for me and my chest.

Concept is very much similar to Hooga so i guess the more the competition, the better for us consumers. Their range is not as diversed as Hooga, but they do have some interesting stuff on display. Pricing is a little more on the high side, but overall its still quite ok. | review_rating:4, text:Exceptionally affordable pricing for homeware, kitchenware and tableware (hardly anything over $30aud!!!)🤯😱

My haul was substantial due to the crazy good deals to be had🤭, and they were very accommodating, wrapping each piece of flatware, as well as allowed me to inspect the tea box before finalising my purchase.

I'd say Objet is the Malaysian equivalent to Kmart here in Sydney. Good value, not the highest quality items but still worth it - For example, the tea box I bought had a knob that I needed to buy the correct screw for, in order for it to sit securely on the lid and thus be functional. Not a deal breaker for me, but would be annoying for those not into figuring out a surprise DIY project 😅🛠 would return nonetheless!

1888 was the year Obermain began creating quality shoes and boots in Burgkunstadt, a town on the Upper Main River whose leather goods were sought by elite professionals in turn of the century Germany. Burgkunstadt’s legacy of craftsmanship and material excellence lives on today – in shoes, bags, and accessories designed by Obermain to continue our proud tradition.
Obermain invites men and women to step into a new kind of comfort, the kind that overcomes outdated compromises that pit form versus function, wearability versus appeal, and tradition versus modernity. Where quality workmanship and materials assure durability. Where special comfort features make every step – leisurely on brisk, on carpet or concrete – lighter, softer, more flexible, and more secure. Where style means a contemporary touch and updated details that set you at ease weekdays and weekends. The perfect union of quality, comfort, and style. Obermain is made for striding with confidence through every walk of life.
We design our products to be loved and used for a long time. We may apply classic silhouettes or re-interpret them with a twist. If we do this, we must keep the shoe silhouette recognizable. We are not slaves to fashion, yet we may adapt trends as touches of modernity—subtly and tastefully.

The green tea is particularly impressive, flavorful, and worth the price. Although the spaghetti is on the pricier side, it’s worth it, with fresh prawns cooked perfectly.

We ordered tea and dessert, which tastes really good and reasonable to the pricing. However, management needs to put in the time to train their employees to elevate the place.

I looked at the menu and saw so many different types of teas. This is for people who are willing to pay the money to try out nuances between different types of teas.
The place presents itself as a more sophisticated place, not just your regular cafe. So, I asked the waitress for recommendations.

To my disappointment, the waitresses there were clearly part-timers hired to only serve tables. They also didn't have a person dedicated to recommend teas or talk about why is it brewed a certain way.

This should have been the selling point of the place-- yet it is not fully utilized.

From this experience, it goes from a potential spot for tea lovers who want to try different types of teas-- to suddenly just a regular cafe.

To be honest, the staff were polite, I find no fault in the service itself. I just can tell that no further training was given for them -- or 1 dedicated person -- to make the experience better. Again, I wouldn't write this much if it's just a regular cafe.

I can see that there is potential, and I can tell what the initial vision was.  I hope to see the place improve over time, or, to accept the route of being a regular cafe, where customers will start to ask about the price versus what you're getting.

- The sauce appears watery, pooling around the edges of the plate, which indicates poor consistency.
- The sauce-to-spaghetti ratio seems off, with an excess of liquid making the dish look less appetizing.

2. Chicken Chop with Fries and Coleslaw
- The chicken chop looks over-sauced, which might result in a soggy texture, especially if it's fried.
- The sauce consistency appears thin and overly glossy, which might make the dish feel greasy.
- Fries seem undercooked or lacking a crispy appearance, making them look unap

- The iced drink has a murky appearance, which could be due to uneven mixing or dilution from melted ice.
- The lemon slice is visible but seems more like an afterthought rather than a deliberate garnish.

During a recent lunch treat by my boss, I opted for the Grilled Vege Ciabatta, a delightful combination of chargrilled vegetables nestled in a warm, crusty ciabatta. The flavors were well-balanced, and the fresh ingredients made for a hearty and satisfying bite. Accompanying my meal was the Lemongrass Mojito, an incredibly refreshing drink that was the perfect antidote to the sweltering afternoon heat. The vibrant mix of lemongrass and mint was both cooling and invigorating—highly recommended for those looking for a non-alcoholic thirst-quencher.

During an initial visit, I tried on many different pairs and was attended to by Nelson, who politely and calmly helped me with my choices. But, I didn't get anything, thinking that I should look around first.

However, I didn't receive the same treatment elsewhere, even though I found something I really liked. And because of that, I went back to Oopa to get two pairs because of the service level.

The range that they have here may not be as much as others, but you feel really satisfied spending your money here for the service and care that's shown as a customer - and that's priceless.

That’s just natural given how popular and the reputation it has among the locals like myself. I only visited their branch in KLIA but not the one here.

So when my family arrived at this branch this morning, there was a pretty long cue. But what I admire most was how quick their staff got their act together in ensuring each waiting customer gets welcome and directed to their seats while not getting them to wait too long. I personally thought their service was pretty professional and efficient.

Their environment was pretty spot on as it gives off the classy kopitiam vibes.

Now, when it comes to their food & beverages. Their coffee is certainly not bad but is definitely not the best I’ve tried. Their famous Ipoh Hor Fun was rather bland and am not too sure why it’s much to shout about. I certainly have tried much better Ipoh Hor Fun out there. But don’t let that ruin your entire experience at this restaurant. The saving grace for me and is one of their must try dishes if you’re here is their Nasi Lemak and their Kaya & Butter Toast bun as well as their Oriental Polo Bun.

•	Convenient Layout: Despite its size, the mall is well-organized, making navigation easy.

Having launched its ecommerce business in Singapore in 2017, the brand was known for its premium value gaming monitors that offered the best performance at wallet-friendly prices. Following its success in the gaming space, the brand then launched its own brand of Android TVs, which it is best known for today.

In 2021, PRISM+ brought its brand of direct-to-consumer ecommerce business model to Malaysia to great reception. The brand’s introduction of its 86” Android TV, the Q86 PRO-QE, shook the market for large screen TVs at never-before-seen prices. – and quickly became the top-selling Android TV and Monitor brands in e-commerce. Since then, the brand has moved from strength-to-strength and is now looking to venture beyond its ecommerce origins with its very first experiential store at Sunway Pyramid. Its store in Sunway Pyramid is the first of its kind outside of Singapore, which launched its first physical stores in August 2022, and sees the brand name Malaysia as a key market for its growth. Not forgetting its gaming roots, PRISM+ has also partnered with Logitech to offer gaming peripherals at its offline store, as part of its commitment in offering customers a holistic experience. The brand will continue to expand its offerings in Malaysia, with the Sunway Pyramid store serving as a physical touchpoint for its fans to experience its latest product launches. As the first physical store in Malaysia, PRISM+ at Sunway Pyramid is a signal of ambition from the fast-growing consumer electronics brand as it gears towards its next big move. In Singapore, the brand recently announced its first smart home appliance, the PRISM+ Zero, and has teased that it will move in the same direction in Malaysia – while continuing to offer the best deals for Android TVs, productivity, and gaming monitors and more.

They promised a simple one-on-one exchange process for warranty claims, but the reality was far from that. Instead of a straightforward exchange or repair, I was forced to jump through countless hoops and complete endless steps just to get any kind of response. After all of that, they didn’t even exchange or repair the defective product.

What makes this worse is that they don’t even have a service center to handle issues directly. It’s all just a frustrating online back-and-forth with no actual support. I regret purchasing from this company and would advise others to stay away unless you want to deal with endless delays and a complete lack of customer care. | review_rating:2, text:I bought a Google TV Q series in 2022 via PRISM online platform (it comes with 2 years warranty).Now - Nov 24, my TV is 2 years 10 months old, it starts having problem, blank (black) screen after power on.

I ordered the Big Breakfast and upgraded the complimentary black coffee to a latte for an additional RM 5.00.

**Big Breakfast:**
- Taste: 9/10
- Portion: 5/10

The tomato was too large and not grilled for added flavor. It would have been better if it were served in smaller pieces. Additionally, there was only one small piece of bread.

The service was okay, though only one counter was open and card payment was unavailable. However, the food was brought to the table. | review_rating:4, text:Many choices and types of breads, buns and pastries to choose from. They also provide cooked foods such as big breakfast. The buns were quite good, soft, balanced between the sweetness and buttery. Coffee a bit bitter but overall it was hot and nice.

Services were reasonable. Prices were above average. | review_rating:4, text:Garlic Bread with Cream Cheese was very garlicky, with quite a strong raw garlic taste (iykyk). Mushroom soup in bread bowl was abit expensive, and very salty for my taste. Overall, good to try once but would not return again.

I ordered the chicken pie that came with a side of brown gravy and mashed potato. The pie crust was okay although I wished it was a little lighter and fluffier. It was also not as warm as I would have preferred it. Nonetheless, the filling was flavorful with a mix of chicken and mushroom. For the price however, they could have given more pieces of chicken.

Service was relatively fast although there were only 2 occupied tables.

The carbonara was rich, creamy, and made even more indulgent by a runny poached egg. The deep-fried chicken ham added a satisfying crunch and extra savouriness. We also had an iced gula melaka and an orange juice—both decent choices.

Price-wise, Pineyard leans slightly towards the higher end, but I must say the service was prompt and friendly. | review_rating:5, text:I had their carbonara for dinner and it was so good, I really love it. I also bought their pasties and they're really soft even if you eat it the next day.

The price for the dish and pastries are slightly expensive but I'd say it matched with the quality of the food.

I love that they're always adding and updating more new books, and that they regularly have promotions going on.

However, sometimes they have too many overlapping promotions that even their system cannot handle and the staff are not familiar with. There have been too many instances where I find same books (same publication, size etc), but they're tagged different prices. Some books are tagged a certain amount but when I got to the counter, they said they were tagged wrongly and the price was actually higher than displayed by the tag.

As a regular patron, this had happened too many times especially when they have many different promotions at the same time (ie all books for 20% for 2 books or more but they also have 10% on fiction so if you buy fiction, even if you buy 2 books or more, you're only entitled to get 10% each). This makes the shopping experience here very unpleasant. The only way to know for sure how much you have to pay exactly is by checking at the counter, which is troublesome especially if there's large crowd.

However, other than this, I really like this outlet because of the variety of books available. Hope they'll improve on the system and pricing especially when they want to have overlapping discounts.",4.4,+60 3-5637 7280,"Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Tuesday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Wednesday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Thursday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Friday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Saturday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Sunday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM"

However, recent visit to this particular Putien restaurant located at Sunway Pyramid was disappointing. Perhaps it was due to Chinese New Year that the dishes from the set meal were served in a rush and a few of the dishes were served at the same time.

The table is not big enough and the staff were busy transferring the dishes to smaller plates. It was chaotic and customers were not able to eat in peace. The acoustic was poor and it was really noisy. The squirrel fish was over fried and stingy with the sauce.

On the 21/11/2024, I bought my AirPods 4 in Nu Sentral @ Machines.
However, on the 29/11/2024, I found out that my left side AirPods had this windy sound which should not be there. I went to the nearest Machines and they told me that I have to go for their service provider, which the nearest is Sunway Pyramid for me.

First Visit (29/11): After getting my AirPods diagnosed, the staff and the technician said it was fine. I was very doubtful, and I left. BUT! The issue came back again! So, I booked another appointment with the service provider.

Second Visit (30/11): I left my AirPods with them again and I agreed to the 3-7 days checking.

Third Visit (3/12): I was told that my AirPods were fine. SHOCKED with the outcome, I tested the AirPods in front of them and the issue is STILL THERE. I even told the staff to try it out, and the staff let the technician tried it out too.
Guess what? THEY JUST CONFIRMED THE ISSUE RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

I was like: Wait, I waited FOR NOTHING.

The pissed off moment was: Even though I bought my AirPods on the 21/11, I have not done ANY damages to it (why would I? RM829 weyh), I solely DESERVE a full-on exchange of the product.

But? The service provider staff SAID NO. You have to leave the AirPods 4 AGAIN to check if the issue persists.

I was like: WAIT. HOLD UP. You just confessed that there IS an issue. Why do you need to wait for it again?
I demanded a full-on exchange of the ENTIRE product. The staff had to go back and called the manager (WHO, BY THE WAY, HE/SHE ISN’T EVEN IN THE OFFICE).
Furiously, I demanded to talk to the manager on the phone, but the staff refused to.
After the bickering, the staff went back in the room, came out, and agreed to swap THE LEFT SIDE OF THE AIRPODS 4.
I was like, NO WAY. I am entitled to have a full exchange of the product.

Conclusion:-
1. I am still waiting for another 3-7 days.
2. I want a full-on exchange (didn’t get it)
3. And the manager isn’t there at all.

Unprofessional and betrayed by the service of Machines and this service provider.

I will keep on updating my complaint.

It’s a symbol of our passion that compels us to bring people the absolute best footwear products in the world. What drives us to reimagine, redefine and redesign everything we know about sandals, and do that again, and again, and again.
It’s the pride we have in ourselves and what we’ve stood for since day 1 – delivering the freedom of surf life through expertly crafted experiences.
It’s having long lasting trust in our partners to bring our brand to life in the most authentic way possible and working together through whatever the world throws our way.
‘Reef since 1984’ is more than just a number. It’s who we are.
In 1984, two entrepreneurial brothers from South America named Fernando and Santiago Aguerre founded REEF out of a love for the beach and surfing.Their idea was to create high-quality, super comfortable products that fit the lifestyle they loved.
Fernando and Santi walked everywhere, so they created sandals that could take them to the beach, into town and wherever they wanted to go – in comfort.
The brothers redefined, redesigned and reengineered every component of the sandal. That attention to detail and an uncompromising standard of quality made Reef the most comfortable sandals anybody had ever worn.

Bankara’s brand values and product offerings are unmistakably Japanese, yet differentiated from the market competitors in tantalizing the customers dining experience, namely the palette and sensory immersion.
Embracing the philosophy “Cooking by Heart”’ the Bankara brand is the result of Mr. Kusano’s desire to constantly innovate and improve the taste of Japanese ramen. Drawing upon his family’s expertise handed down through the generations, Mr. Kusano embarked on a request in selecting the finest of ingredients and cooking techniques, to develop a new ramen soup recipe.
In 1998, the “Impact” taste so broadly associated with the brand, heralded the arrival of the Bankara Signature Ramen. The journey to tantalise our customer’s five senses; taste, smell, sight, sound and touch, begin here.
(Taste & Smell) “Cooking by Heart”, Bankara Ramen Malaysia serves four authentic Japanese ramen styles namely Bankara Signature, Tonkotsu ramen, Miso ramen and Tsukemen. Each ramen style is clearly defined by the soup and accompanying noodles of varying thickness and texture. We are proud to serve the same quality and flavour in every bowl of ramen, as one would come to expect if one was dining in Japan. Selected ingredients imported from Japan, attention to details and preparation ensures we serve the most authentic “Impact” taste ramen that you will truly savour and crave for.

Total price: RM101.95 (incld 16% tax)

1. Ramen Bankara - RM25.90 - The soup is strong with pork broth, it really comes from the pork bone essence. Taste very nice and ramen is chewy and good.
2. Tsukemen - RM30 - This is special, and had stronger taste. Ramen is much thicker and chewy than Bankara.
3. Chicken Nanban - RM21 - The nanban sauce is mix with mayo, egg and some salad. And the chicken although not hot, but crispy. The mixture of it is nice.
4. Almond Drink - RM11 - Their handmade honey almond drink, it is very dense and the almond taste will not too strong until you hardly accept it. The honey did neutralise the almond flavour.

- Environment is good and comfortable.

Overall, it is good choice for ramen, just the price range is slightly at the high side.

The pork belly has been cooking for so long, it just melts as soon as your chopsticks touch it. Not my kind of noodles, it's on the thicker side, but it grabs onto the broth very well. Just wished they given us the option to choose the level doneness of the noodles. The tsukemen is probably three times the salty level of the ramen, but it's good none the less. The option to add garlic tableside was great. Really elevates the flavour of the broth. | review_rating:4, text:Tried their tonkatsu broth and is flavorsome and thick.

I usually get the Torikoku Original, which is a ramen dish with lightweight but flavourful chicken broth. They're always super generous on the chicken - they're so thick and big, and I'd struggle to finish everything unless I'm absolutely starving.

I also love the black fungus topping - it adds a nice crunch, and they give plenty of chopped green things (don't know what it is but it adds nice flavour).

I love the noodles they use too. They're nice and thin, and never undercooked or overcooked. They always taste on point. The chicken broth tastes best hot (always served hot anyway) and is great for rainy days.

I'm surprised it's almost always empty when I come here haha. I think the price charged for the quality of food is very reasonable. I hope more people will come here more often because I don't want one of my favourite ramen places to close down...I haven't found any other place that serves ramen like this 🙏🙏🙏

•	Diverse Shopping: With a wide array of shops, it caters to all family members, from fashion to gadgets.
•	Family-Friendly Activities: The mall features an indoor ice-skating rink and a massive arcade that are perfect for kids and adults alike. My daughter loves to play at Parenthood. They have upgraded it too recently and we enjoyed it.
•	Food Haven: Offers an extensive selection of dining options from fast food to upscale restaurants. For Indian food you can try Mantra Restaurant (Not great but decent)
•	Convenient Layout: Despite its size, the mall is well-organized, making navigation easy.
•	Themed Decor: The Egyptian-inspired architecture adds a unique charm, making every visit memorable.

1.    This was my first time dining at the restaurant.
2.	I was particularly impressed by the front counter staff member, Nicole, who provided an excellent introduction to the menu. Her friendly demeanor and warm smile made the experience welcoming, and she explained the menu thoroughly, understanding customers’ preferences and offering tailored recommendations. Her attentiveness and professionalism in promoting the dishes contributed to a positive first impression.
3.	Regarding the dining experience, there was one point of dissatisfaction with the garlic butter side dish. Although I ordered garlic butter, it arrived without any butter. I requested it a second time, but unfortunately, it was still served without butter. I also noticed a customer at a nearby table sharing similar feedback with the staff.
4.	When I mentioned this issue to Nicole, she was genuinely surprised and expressed her intention to relay the feedback to her supervisor. Her responsiveness and willingness to address the concern, despite it being a minor issue, were greatly appreciated.

Overall Impression: Aside from the missing butter, the overall dining experience was enjoyable, thanks largely to Nicole’s kindness and helpfulness. Her proactive approach to resolving the issue demonstrated her commitment to customer satisfaction. | review_rating:3, text:I was here 23/12/24 and i came here to eat at 2.22pm till around 4.15pm.

This is a truly authentic SHABU SHABU restaurant experience.",G1.99 (Ground Floor),"Malaysia, Selangor, Subang Jaya, Bandar Sunway, Jalan PJS 11/15, Lot G1.99, Ground floor","review_rating:2, text:Shabu-yo, what happened?

- Menu changed from beef, pork, chicken TO lamb, pork, chicken.
- if you want beef, need to choose beef, pork, lamb and chicken. (More expensive)
Price increased, which is not the main issue.

THE PROBLEM IS:

Meat quality dropped!
(My partner and I hoped that this day would never come)
First time we came here was in 2023, we thought the quality of meat here was amazing especially for the price range. The pork belly/shoulder and beef karubi used to be so tender, but I can no longer say it is the same.
We are regular customers and we recommended this restaurant to many of our friends and family (because of the beautiful meat quality), but now we have to think twice if we’d want to eat here again.
- When sat down at our table, we found out that even EGGS are no longer part of the buffet. They need to be added on for RM1/egg. So extremely disappointing!!!
- sauces here isn’t very good but the meat dipped in eggs always made it better, again, utterly disappointed with Shabu-yo charging for eggs (?!?!?!)

- kitchen staff is so noisy. Dropping bowls and plates and cheering every time someone drops another bowl/plate. Kinda annoying to be hearing this when seated near the kitchen.

Honestly, all this complaints could be tolerated but then the meat quality dropped, that’s not ok with me. | review_rating:5, text:I love this place. They have reasonable price for buffet and their meat and veggies choices are so much more than other japanese buffet. I also like that they have high quality onzen egg that you could eat raw. | review_rating:1, text:The worse steamboat buffet I've ever been, this will be my first and last in this restaurant. All the staff have to go through deep and serious training. Even the foods was so so only, everywhere is very messy tot think that it's not that busy. And even though on busy times should not let your buffet bar messy, dirty tissues everywhere, veggies all over the place. Staffs no basic manners, clear table just take plates, serve the food just bang on your table without saying anything. All are black face and not talking, robot is better at least they greet but these people nothing. But when they are chatting while clearing tables their voices are so loud and happy back to customer gave you poker unhappy face. Most of the waitresses hair are so messy too not appropriate in F&B standard. Kitchen door widely open can see how messy and dirty inside, staff room door open too showing us all shoes while eating is it? The another long hair waitress arranging all the pots banging so loud makes the diners disturb if not happy why not go back home. Ice cream melted, waffle bitter and put there no cover at all. Your golden soup is the worse I've ever tasted too no taste at all, other beef cutting is wrong side making it so tough. Most of the sauces are all chili taste without any saltiness or sweetness I know we can add on seasoning but do we need to adjust everything on our own meh? I came here because it was recommended by my colleague who always eat at Sunway Velocity, she said must try very nice. I was totally in regret that I tried and paid full price with 10% service charge without even providing any service. | review_rating:5, text:food are 9/10! especially their ice cream is sooooo CREAMY and not too sweet.

They have rice, fries, takoyaki, chicken karaage, desserts like ice shaved, and waffle making in the buffet menu. Which is very reasonable for its price.

The buffet is about 40 rinngit gross, but that includes the mains to drinks and desserts.  Dining limits to 90 mins.

Quite a few choices of base soup. it's less tasty than arashi, though, but very accoetable for its price. . Many staff were  around to help.

Ordered chicken kebab today (though I almost got hurt biting into a bone chip). Saw another review here that they also found bone chips in their kebabs. Something that I've not encountered in their other outlets. Perhaps a quality control issue.

The newly renovated stuff'd now uses machine ordering. The machine lagged when I was making payment, and staff were too busy to entertain my problems because Grab riders were more of a priority. After awhile, one of them rerouted the payment to the normal counter cashier (what was the point of the machine, then?)

Waiting time: Almost 20 minutes for a kebab. Not really acceptable considering most customers are here during their short lunch break. Like I've mentioned up there, they prioritize Grabfood more than walk-in orders.

I had to produce a receipt before she was able to retrieve my purchases which I had already paid for. There was no manager on duty and i couldnt lodge an official complain.

It shock me to see the food come out this way. Big brand, but presentation and food quality is totally out. Ordered the Sundubu Jjigae RM26 (soup is cook with chilli flakes. Too much, it tends to be bitter), taste like f*&^%.....oooops mind my language, tofu smashed, eggs gone, my jjigae become a pile of vomits (check out my photo & Sakae photo). Kimchi fried rice RM22 (portion was unbelievable small) & finally Kyushu Paitan Ramen Rm20 (Soup terribly oily, noddles overcook, taste wise 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢) . Well, bye-bye & tata to this restaurant. Horrible meal. I seldom give 1 star unless it's really terrible. | review_rating:2, text:Had the worst shoyu ramen today. Soggy noodles, tasteless broth. It's a large portion of noodles, which is usually a good thing for me but with this one it felt like it took forever to finish it because it just wasn't good. Added probably 2 tbsp of their table soy sauce into the soup. It's possible the dish was left too long before it was served, because there was very little soup - maybe all soaked up by the noodles 🙈  Even my husband, who likes his noodles soft, didn't enjoy this.

The kimchi lava fried rice was also mediocre - the rice was mushy (my husband liked it that way tho), not enough flavour so this also had to be eaten with their soy sauce. The ""lava"" is just a runny egg omelette - you need to top up cheese to get the cheesey effect shown in the photos. At least we got a 20% discount for this dish though.

The lack of communication, persistent stock shortages, and difficulty in reaching the service centre have caused significant inconvenience. Below is a timeline of the incident and my key concerns.

Timeline of the Incident:
16 February 2025 – I contacted the Sunway Pyramid service centre to schedule a screen replacement for my Samsung S23 Ultra. I was informed that the screen was out of stock but would be restocked on 18 February 2025. Following this, I requested to book an appointment for 22 February 2025, and the service centre advised me to send my details via WhatsApp. I did so, and they acknowledged my request with a ""noted"" response. Based on this, I assumed my appointment was confirmed.

22 February 2025 – I called the service centre to reschedule my appointment to 23 February 2025. It was only then that I was informed that the screen was still out of stock.

Complaint Points:
Poor Communication – If I had not called on 22 February, I would have traveled to the service centre on 23 February only to find out the screen was still unavailable. Why wasn’t I informed in advance that the stock had not arrived? As a service provider, the service centre should proactively notify customers if their scheduled repairs cannot proceed due to stock unavailability.

Frequent Stock Shortages – Why does the service centre frequently face stock shortages for essential replacement parts? Does this mean customers will always have to wait indefinitely to get their devices repaired? Being unable to use my phone for an extended period has caused unnecessary inconvenience, and potential financial losses.

Extremely Difficult to Contact – I found it extremely difficult to reach the service centre. As an authorized service provider for a global brand like Samsung, the service centre should have a more accessible and responsive customer support system.

The poor service I experienced has been frustrating and unacceptable. As a loyal Samsung customer, I expect better service quality and a more reliable repair process | review_rating:2, text:Left my fold 4 with the center on Saturday, received a call to collect in on Thursday. They claim to replace the screen but I can see that it is still the same screen (there is a slight mark on the screen. It is still there, meaning it's the same screen). They fix the issue with the phone turning off when using the inner screen. However, the center returned my phone with scratches and screen bubbling. They do not handle your phone with care. I suggest take lots of photo and video as evidence before you hand over to them. | review_rating:5, text:came in with a flip 3 samsung that half of the screen was damage, i want to tranfers my data from that phone but couldnt since the screen cant be use. the obvious solution was to replace the flip 3 screen that cost rm1k but i dont want to do that since it was an old phone and already have a new one. however, there was this nice uncle samsung worker who go out of his way to help me, even took out a usb mouse to help me tranfer the data. couldnt be more grateful for the uncle | review_rating:1, text:Brought my s20 to repair for cracked screen but after repair my screen have issues with tapping which it move around itself. Visiting 2nd time within a week and informed that my phone when sent it to them it is already have this issue which supposed I am sure supposed not to be. As luckily I have video record as proof my phone condition before left my phone to them.

The problem didn't been solved and I don't wish to send my phone there again. Now it become my backup phone and I bought another new phone because of their poor workmanship.

Please be reminded they may told you estimated 4 to 5 working days but you still need to chase them for a follow-up and at last can be taken even more than 1 week time to collect your item. Worst thing is your phone's problem didn't get solved after long waiting time.

I am a Samsung users for more than 10 years but tbh if your phone have problems, it is better you find phone repair specialist rather than their authorized service center. Why? because my new phone's screen cracked again and i decided to bring my to phone repair specialist.

Shop smart! | review_rating:1, text:I recently visited Sephora to inquire about a tinted moisturizer, and while the consultant initially seemed helpful, things took a sharp turn when I decided not to make a purchase. Her attitude shifted noticeably, and she walked off without so much as a polite closing remark. I understand that not every consultation leads to a sale, but being professional and courteous shouldn’t depend on the customer’s buying decision.

It was disappointing to feel dismissed for simply taking time to consider my options. Sephora is known for creating a welcoming shopping environment, but this experience fell short.

Burger had sufficient crust and the meatiness came thru. I appreciate a burger that’s more about the meat and cheese and less about the sauce it’s drowned in. Was better than the one in TRX.

Fries were fresh, crispy and well salted but I’m not a fan of crinkle cut. The 50-50 had a strong lemony taste with a hint of tea. Not too sweet.

Overall not too bad, though go into it like you’re getting a burger at a sit down restaurant, not fast food as the prices are definitely not cheap. | review_rating:2, text:Honestly expected a lot from a burger for this price range I mean its not five guys lol.

Taste was average or should I say no taste at all ? Loads of meat does NOT equal to good food.

Exorbitant price for the burger and it comes on its own ? Bro are you serious no sides I mean at least should mention that on the menu so that we can order the sides together.

Well tried both the normal fries and cheese fries both were below average.

Nothing in particular that stands out except the hype.

In short doesn’t taste like what it looks like. | review_rating:5, text:Located at the entrance of Sunway Pyramid. This is the second Shake Shack American burger restaurant in town (1st outlet at TRX).

The burgers here looks small in size but really packs a punch! Their signature smoky flavours makes it quite hard to stop eating as soon as you take the first bite. Go for their hot favourite  ""Double Shack"" burger and addictive crinkled cut fries. Hot dog is on the menu too.

Wonderful experience with each and every bite! Definitely worth returning. | review_rating:3, text:Not the best, but certainly not the worst burger joint either. Would say that I'd rate Shake Shack a little higher if the prices wasn't so outrageous.
I ordered the Avocado strraky beef burger. Taste-wise, I do l like their burger buns, but the burger itself was lacking any smokeyness or flavor. The ice cream, was just like any other ice cream. And lastly the Malaysia-exclusive Bunga Raya Shake, which was way too sweet too the point that I couldn't finish it.
But other than that, service was great, and the whole place had a nice vibe to it. | review_rating:2, text:I wouldn’t say the best burger in town. I only love the fact the crispy beef streak was good and the burger is juicy and not greasy. The hotdog was hard and dry. I can’t say I like the shake, too sweet and not thick enough.

I went to the G floor branch (next to Parkson).

The first time I went to counter 1 to change A currency, I said I wanted to split two receipts, he said he couldn’t split the transaction and asked me to queue up again.

OK, Second time I went to counter 1 again (only 1 counter is open) and changed A currency.

Seeing that there was no one in line behind me, I said I wanted to change B currency, he said no, he could only change money from one country per person at a time, which means I had to wait until someone came to queue up to change money before I could change money for the third time?

Meanwhile counter 2 is open, then I pointed to counter 2 and asked if I could change money, counter 1 said NO, because counter 2 is new and he didn’t know how to do it.

First, they doesn't seems very familiar with the name of the drink on the reserved menu. They need to double check on the menu to confirm what's really customer mentioned when place order.

Secondly, the ticket doesn't place / stick well to the drinks producing counter. It caused that no barista noticed that there are a pending order to make (reserve coffee menu). After all, they keep calling customer name while food ready but nobody making the drink.

At the end,  the drink has served finally, but as photo shown, been ordered a Reserve menu coffee, but served without the Starbucks Reserve black sleeve and the complimentary chocolate. Definitely not well trained enough.

Then I saw a barista served the food over to a female customer to her table but forgot the drink itself. The female customer has to get up and go over the waiting section to get the drink by herself after all.

Wanted two ears to be pierced at the same time so that it could be done at one go. They marked the piercing area first. To my horror the junior staff pierced higher than the marked area. We had to remove the piercing and pierce another time. In total 3 times.  This traumatised my poor child. They claim they are professionals in piercing children's ears. They can't even pierce according to their markings. Paid a very high price for this just to get my daughter traumatized. | review_rating:5, text:Had my second piercing done here. Staffs are very friendly and helpful in their recommendations. They also teach you how to take care of the piercing.

I was worried about getting my ear pierced because I have sensitive skin, but the staff was really helpful in providing information on the items and materials.

Fear not, every stud is inside the cartridge itself, which is dispose after each piercing and is extremely sterile and hygienic.

To make sure the piercing is taken care of, I also received a complimentary aftercare package that includes a small bottle of lotion and a monthly check-up for 3 months so they can keep an eye on your healing process!

2) Just as my food was served, I saw a cockroach climbing on my table. I raised my hand for so long (and 3 times) yet no one comes.

The customer service is so bad that I will never come here anymore. I absolutely DON'T recommend this restaurant to anyone. | review_rating:1, text:1. Customer service is out! No greetings, No smile and No explaination given as to how to order etc.

When asked their staff, they said oh! gyudon & yakiniku is actually the cooking style (MEANS THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE PRODUCT KNOWLEDGE)! No manager / No supervisor at the outlet. Staff had to call the manager and to my surprise, even the manager do not have product knowledge as to what is gyudon & yakiniku is! Manager blammed on the management.

• Sunway Lagoon Extreme Park
It is the best place to get your adrenaline pumping! Feel the rush with aerial attractions like bungee jumping, flying fox, riding a Go Kart or an ATV, wall climbing and so much more!
• Sunway Lagoon Water Park
The Sunway Lagoon Water Park is a great stop to beat the Malaysian heat. From daring water spins in the African Pythons loop ride, to the Congo Challenge, Vuvuzela and Waterplexx 5D, be ready for a grand, wet day out in the sun! For those looking for a more relaxing pace, drop by the Surf Beach, which is said to be the world's largest man-made surf beach (arrive early to grab a curtained gazebo for that extra tropical feeling).
Of course proper swimming attire is required for this section of the park, changing rooms and lockers are provided.
• Sunway Lagoon Amusement Park
Do not want to get wet? You can explore the amusement park and walk on the bridge in Sunway lagoon theme park which is known as Malaysia’s longest pedestrian.
• Nickelodeon Lost Lagoon
This is Asia's first Nickelodeon themed park and includes exciting water rides and attractions. Enjoy your day in the company of memorable Nickelodeon characters from Spongebob Squarepants, Dora The Explorer and even the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as you explore around with the kids (souvenirs are aplenty too).
• Wildlife Park
Wildlife Park is a great little zoo specializing in cute, cuddly, friendly animals and a few not-so-cuddly ones like eagles, pythons and tigers. The petting enclosure is a major attraction with families, where you can enjoy hand-feeding the rabbits, tortoises, guinea pigs and petting the ponies too!

I genuinely cannot understand why this place gets 5-star ratings. The ride attendants are rude and unhelpful, and customer service is clueless—even the so-called “customer specialists” don’t know how to handle guests. The park itself is old, decaying, and poorly maintained. The shacks and huts are a complete waste of time, and the wave pool only operates for 45 minutes at the very end of the day. The whole place smells bad and feels like it’s falling apart.

For a family of five, we spent $700 AUD—absolutely not worth it. There are so many better places in Malaysia to visit for a fraction of the cost. Even with a quick pass, there was no need to wait for rides, which only made the purchase feel like a scam. The photos online are misleading, so don’t fall for the marketing.

The wife was happy to watch some of our stuff near the small wave pool while the kids and I hit the rides. It was a great time for us to go as there were not very big crowds meaning it did not take very long to get on the rides other than climbing all the steps to get up to them. Highly recommended for all the family from young kids to young adults. The big wave pool with 5m high waves every 1 minute from 4.30pm was a highlight too. Make sure you get to the front. | review_rating:5, text:Each park was truly fun. There are a lot of activities for you to do despite age. There are many water activities. So, it's wise you wear your swimwear and roam around. There are lockers in every park as I remember and you can rent a locker to keep your belongings safe. I went on  weekend so there were too many people and had to wait in lines for a considerable amount of time. But enter the place when it opens and you can enjoy every activity.

Apart from the water park, Sunway Lagoon has various other attraction parks like a small zoo, Scream room a 5 D theatre and many other attractions. You get an entrance band to go to all activities. Once you reach the park you need to go down with multiple level escalator. There are many changing areas separate for both men and women with showers and different size lookers to store your belongings and clothes. Overall it was a family fun for the whole day. | review_rating:5, text:My wife and I recently booked the villa package for 2 days and 1 night at around RM1.6K, and we had an amazing experience! A big thank you to Sunway for allowing us to check in early at 11 AM instead of the usual 2 PM. This thoughtful gesture made our trip so much smoother, as we could head straight to the theme park without worrying about our belongings.

The villa itself was spacious, beautifully designed, and incredibly comfortable—perfect for a relaxing retreat. A special shoutout to Shahmin and his team for their outstanding hospitality; they were friendly, helpful, and truly enhanced our stay. While the food was decent, it could be improved to match the overall high standards of the experience.

Overall, we would rate our stay 8.5/10 and would definitely consider returning. Thank you, Sunway, for a wonderful time! | review_rating:1, text:Disappointing Experience – Not Worth the Money

I genuinely cannot understand why this place gets 5-star ratings. The ride attendants are rude and unhelpful, and customer service is clueless—even the so-called “customer specialists” don’t know how to handle guests. The park itself is old, decaying, and poorly maintained. The shacks and huts are a complete waste of time, and the wave pool only operates for 45 minutes at the very end of the day. The whole place smells bad and feels like it’s falling apart.

For a family of five, we spent $700 AUD—absolutely not worth it. There are so many better places in Malaysia to visit for a fraction of the cost. Even with a quick pass, there was no need to wait for rides, which only made the purchase feel like a scam. The photos online are misleading, so don’t fall for the marketing.

This was our experience in January/February 2025.

Being the first world class ice sports entertainment in Malaysia where you can enjoy a day of ice-skating to escape the heat of Kuala Lumpur, Sunway Pyramid Ice has played host to numerous international sports competitions and musicals since 1997. With a rink size spanning 39m x 22.5m, shoppers can have a breathtaking view of this ice-skating rink's sleek-modern design from above thanks to glass panels surrounding each level. On and off, you can catch a sight of experienced skaters practising their routines and perfecting their stunts, as Sunway Pyramid Ice is part of ISIAsia (Ice Skating Institute Asia), which trains professional figure-skaters in Malaysia.
Spend only a total of RM20 on weekdays, RM25 on weekends and RM28 during school and public holidays to enjoy the ice-skating rink as much as you like. Although it is a prerequisite to wear gloves and socks when ice-skating, these items are readily available at the ticketing counter for RM6 and RM9 respectively.
It is the birth place where many local skating talents are born and trained by Sunway Pyramid Ice very own coaches through its Skating Academy. Beginners without skating knowledge may opt to take up 30 minute lessons with rates starting at RM70 on weekdays and RM75 on weekends. As you get better in your ice-skating skills, advance lessons may then be an option. This could be a good opportunity for children and young teens to pick up a new skill during school holidays with packages and interesting discounts for classes.

Worth the quick dessert stop. | review_rating:5, text:New cafe located at Sunway Pyramid's newly renovated space, The Oasis. Randomly walked past and saw the variety of cakes sitting in the fridge display.

They have alcoholic and non-alcoholic options. We tried 2 non-alcoholic cakes, cempedak cake and chocolate valrhona cake. The cempedak cake was an absolute delight - sponge layer was soft and light, while the cream was sweet and fresh. Couldn't get enough of it!

Unfortunately, the chocolate valrhona was quite disappointing. The supposed mousse inside was hard and didn't taste fresh. Actually, the whole cake felt pretty tough and hard to cut and chew. It just felt like i was eating a few days' old cake.

Besides cake, they sell gelato, waffles and other desserts too. It's definitely worth a try. | review_rating:5, text:Their tiramisu gelato is the best tiramisu gelato i’ve had.

So I bought a logitech mouse for 300+ which sells between 250-300 on lazada. You have to understand that all shops here especially the tech shops in Asian Avenue will sell items at higher prices. This is because rent for pyramid is high. Those who give ratings such as *overprice* without a good reason - no comments.

I did NOT buy a laptop so I am not aware of the quality of service this place offers and so you have to take ur own risk when buying from here.

Pros: You can exchange faulty peripherals with other peripherals from other brands within 14 days of purchase if u are a member. (Rm300 purchase gives u free membership).

You also get 1 year warranty.

Cons: Slightly more expensive.

_________

My personal opinion: I try not to buy from lazada and stuff for electronic devices because they is no certification that it is original and it is very difficult to exchange or send ur device for warranty when u purchase it online. I would pay the extra RM 50 for the reassurance from this shop. (Peripherals ONLY)

Before we ordered, we did ask the waiter can we share one main course by adding another side dish? If not we just add in the bottomless refill package. (Here i need to mention that I’ve dine in at another branch - Mid Valley so i knew it was workable. And the reason for us to share is we really can’t finish all if we order two main course)

The waiter said OK without explaining anything. But when we ask for refill he take the menu to us said that if u want to refill you need to add the bottomless refill, but we did ask at the very beginning. He said OK! And the way he explain to us is really make us uncomfortable is like we asking for food. But hello? It’s just cabbage? How much it cost? And fine, i know you have your own rules, but why you didn’t mention it clearly at first?

And after that we said nvm, we continue having the rest of our food. After that he suddenly come over and refilled the cabbage for us, without saying anything. This really makes us feel uncomfortably and disrespectful.

The food tastes good but leans towards a heavier and oilier base. If you can't handle spicy food, I’d recommend avoiding the dishes I ordered.

Portion-wise, the servings are generous, but the pricing is on the higher side. For example, the medium-sized Spicy Sour Soup Dory Fish costs RM108, but it's enough to be shared among four ladies. The 双椒辣子鸡 costs RM49, which I find a bit overpriced because the chicken cubes are really small and mixed with other ingredients. Based on the taste, I believe they’ve added fried potato cubes, so most of the dish consists of vegetables—mainly two types of chili and potato cubes. The potato is fine to eat, but the chili depends on your spice tolerance.

Service-wise, I was impressed. They have a unique way of calling for staff using a peace ✌🏻 hand sign, which I found interesting (but personally for me as an introverted person, I was really shy to do it). The service team was attentive and had a good attitude.

I might return, but I’d definitely bring at least two more friends to share the portions—if you're a small eater, you won’t be able to finish everything on your own! | review_rating:5, text:Today finally managed to get a chance to dine here after 2 times failed to get in for the past 1 year.

Fish used was normal though and a tad bit oily.

The chicken in spicy 🌶 oil is worth trying whereas the prawns with fen si is savory but a bit oily as well. The veggies was normal but the fried chicken with sweet & sour sauce was worth the try.

Prepare to wait on hols or weekends but they do have a queue system which is good and the service staff will give u a call when it's your turn. | review_rating:5, text:Some may say it is cheap fish but I think it tasted delicious.

Tea Garden Restaurant at Sunway Pyramid is an absolute gem for anyone looking for delicious Halal-certified Chinese cuisine with a great variety of dishes. The food was fresh, flavorful, and well-presented, making for an excellent dining experience.

We ordered the fried rice, porridge, and stir-fried radish cake, and every dish was perfectly cooked with the right balance of seasoning. The fried rice was aromatic, packed with shrimp and eggs, while the porridge was silky smooth with crispy shallots and fresh spring onions. The radish cake had a nice crisp exterior with soft, flavorful bites.

The ambiance is warm and inviting, perfect for families and friends. The service was fast and friendly, ensuring we had a pleasant meal. With their Halal certification, this restaurant is a great spot for Muslims who love authentic Chinese flavors.

The Body Shop’s new Activist Makers’ Workshop store is a place for play and discovery, where shoppers can get stuck in and get inspired by the brand’s legendary beauty products and ethical purpose.
Customers of the new store will experience new features at this The Body Shop store, one of the most sustainable in Malaysia:
Refill station: The Body Shop is on a mission to use as little plastic as possible with aluminium refill bottles that can be cleaned and brought back to the store to be refilled from 12 of the brand’s best-loved shower gel, shampoo, conditioner and hand wash.
Sustainable store fixtures: The store has been outfitted with sustainable fixtures made from reclaimed wood and recycled plastics to help minimise its environmental footprint. Examples include a metal facade constructed in aluminium, which requires less energy production than other materials and is infinitely recyclable. The store also boasts worktop surfaces that are manufactured from 100% recycled material otherwise destined for the landfill.
The Body Butter Tower: One the most beloved The Body Shop products, The Body Shop body butters are displayed in full glory in a towering rack. With an attached sink, customers can test out different hand wash and shower gels before slathering on their favourite body butter or body lotion at this testing station.
The ACT Wall/Station: This is where brand campaigns and values are shared to customers to create positive engagement with them. From our environmental causes to women empowerment, this wall will be a place to advocate our values.

Entry was swift. Staff are helpful and accommodating. Siligent on cleaning even on a non busy day. It has different play sections, which is good, so older kids will not hurt by accident the younger ones. There are lots of slides, which is fun even for small built adults.

The entrance fee is very reasonable for a whole day play.  About 30 ringgit on weekday / 60 ringgit on weekend, public and school holiday.
Re entry is allowed as long as within that day and with a guardian or parent going in together. Extra guardian or parent is charged 5 ringgit.

Socks is needed to enter like most playgrounds. They charge a reasonable 7 ringgit in case you need it.

There's also a cafe inside where parents could rest while waiting. Opposite the playground is a  shop for kids stuff.

However, I felt a little disappointed as the playground space is smaller than last year, and the horse carousel ride is no longer there. The area feels shorter than before, which affects the overall play experience.

One major concern is safety—the staff should keep an eye on kids playing rough, especially on the big slide. Since children of all ages play together, some older kids don’t follow the play rules, making it scary for kids under 7 to enjoy themselves.

Hope the management can improve the playground space and safety monitoring in the future!",4.2,+60 16-210 4398,"Monday: 10:00 AM – 9:30 PM, Tuesday: 10:00 AM – 9:30 PM, Wednesday: 10:00 AM – 9:30 PM, Thursday: 10:00 AM – 9:30 PM, Friday: 10:00 AM – 9:30 PM, Saturday: 10:00 AM – 9:30 PM, Sunday: 10:00 AM – 9:30 PM"

Staffs were really friendly and nice. The coffee and donuts were good. I like the donuts here. Not oily. Dough texture is fluffy and not very sweet. Price is also very reasonable compared to other cafes in this mall.
I didn't know there are 5 Tim Hortons branches in the country. Will definitely return again. | review_rating:5, text:I visited the new Tim Hortons Signature store at Sunway Pyramid and was impressed! The Maple Cinnamon Latte was perfectly brewed, and the Truffle Mushroom & Cheese Sourdough Melt was delicious. The craft bar concept adds a unique touch, and the donuts were a perfect sweet treat. Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and a must-visit for coffee lovers! | review_rating:5, text:Tried the signature maple cinnamon, about what you'd expect sweet but the cinnamon isn't over powering like the sbux variants. The coffee also came at warm temp not too hot which is ideal.
Had the plain sugar donut, so light just like eating baked flour. I don't think it's anything special given everyone can do donuts these days.
The toasted sourdough sandwiches are pretty decent for the price. Only thing was given only 30% occupied still takes a while to toast. Can't imagine what happens on a packed lunch time.
Also customer service at the tables were poor most tables have cutlery, plates lying around and are unwiped. This would never happen at McDonald's | review_rating:5, text:Had great time indulging good coffee and light bites at this 2nd outlet of Tim Hortons!

Place is well set up, spacious, very cozy and clean.

Service is rather slow, waited for 10 minutes when there’s a really just a handful of patrons in the cafe when we came in. Coffee is served in the paper cup despite they have the ceramic coffee cups displayed (really annoying). Coffee tastes average just like any commercial big chains. Price is reasonable 👍⭐️.

They have been since the very beginning. Stepping outside in any kind of weather was a problem Timberland was born to solve. In 1973 our original waterproof boots called the “Timberland” were invented. They were rugged, well-crafted, and—thanks to an innovative injection moulding technique which was new to the footwear industry—they withstood the elements.
These premium “yellow” boots set new standards for waterproof performance in the footwear industry. They became equally popular with outdoor enthusiasts who needed protection in all conditions, professional trade workers who needed rugged dependable gear, and many others who just wanted a great looking pair of boots. These boots defined our brand. They were so groundbreaking that in 1978 Timberland renamed the entire company.
Today, Timberland Sunway Pyramid is the go-to place for heavy-duty boots and footwear, fit for all harsh elements and weather conditions. Their signature boots are made with durable premium leather consisting of billions of recycled bottles and plastic, an anti-slip rubber lug outsole and anti-fatigue technology with moulded foam footbed to absorb shock and energy while delivering stability and support. For wet and cold environments, Timberland’s waterproof, water-repellent and insulation technology used in their leather and inner footwear membrane will keep you dry, warm and insulated.
Timberland has also developed numerous technologies for all footwear needs – from lightweight soles for long-lasting cushioning in everyday wear to revolutionary grip stick rubber soles for enhanced traction on different tracks and trails. To keep you dry, protected and warm/cool depending on the weather, Timberland’s all-season apparel packs a punch with their specially designed and tailored fabrics such as water-resistant windbreakers, waterproof parkas, cotton linen shirts, packable hoodies for easy storage, organic cotton shorts and tees, stylish polo tees, print tees, stylish construction jackets and much more. Their ranges are available for both men and women, and adaptable for outdoor and indoor.",G1.28 (Ground Floor),"Sunway Pyramid Shopping Centre, Lot G, 1.30, Bandar Sunway, 46150 Petaling Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia","review_rating:5, text:This timberland store has shifted to another shop lot with a brand new store design.

My favourite from this restaurant is there are complimentary soup and gualinko desert.
Tips: Nearby Sunway Pyramid Hotel and recommended when staying at the hotel. | review_rating:5, text:Food is served fast and the meals are delicious and flavorful. Newly renovated more dinning capacity but at peak times there's a queue. | review_rating:4, text:It is a smaller branch compare to Mid Valley. But the dishes are as good as Mid Valley. The queueing time for seating is about 20 minutes during peak hour. If you like to chit chat with family members or friends after the dinner, it is not a suitable restaurant due to the compact dinning area and good business.
I would recommend the Beijing Roast Duck and pork belly with taro which are delicious.",4.1,+60 3-5632 0039,"Monday: 10:00 AM – 9:00 PM, Tuesday: 10:00 AM – 9:00 PM, Wednesday: 10:00 AM – 9:00 PM, Thursday: 10:00 AM – 9:00 PM, Friday: 10:00 AM – 9:00 PM, Saturday: 10:00 AM – 9:00 PM, Sunday: 10:00 AM – 9:00 PM"

no one come & approach us when we enter the shop, we go inside & find our own seat.

The food taste so so bad, i don’t recommend anyone to come try it out, but you can try if you want.

the baked cheese pork rice taste so horrible. As u can see from the picture, the rice is not well mixed with the sauce, the texture of the rice is bad as well, weird smell (think they didnt wash the rice properly), the texture of the pork is hard, which i believe it’s a overnight food.

The culinary landscape in Kuala Lumpur breaks new grounds as the Caffeinees Group of restaurants launches the highly anticipated Yamaguchi Fish Market today, a concept that reimagines the seafood marketplace to serve the freshest catches in town.

Yamaguchi Fish Market is inspired by Karato and Tsukiji Fish Market in Japan where the team sought to bring not only the highest quality and freshest ingredients to seafood lovers but the energetic spirit of the vibrant market as well. The tanks of Yamaguchi Fish Market is filled with fresh catches from seasonal fishes to uni and king crabs that guests can either opt to dine-in and enjoy in a variety of delicious styles or purchase back home at wholesale prices.

Diners will delight in a great variety of fresh-from-the-ocean sashimi and shellfish that the team directly picks up twice a week from the harbour and serve on the extensive and carefully curated menu. Yamaguchi Fish Market’s signature sashimi and grilled seasonal seafood platters is a rich mix of sashimi, shrimps, king crabs, oysters, clams and abalone. For palates of comfort food, the salt baked tai fish, Yamaguchi eel rice and seafood nabemono takes centrestage.
As a marketplace that offers variety in abundance, Yamaguchi Fish Market also takes a local spin onto the ingredients by opening up its menu to offer dishes cooked in local flavors such as salted egg, garlic steam and superior soup.","Suite G-01, The Pinnacle Annexe (Ground Floor)","Suite G-01, Ground Floor, Pinnacle Annexe, Bandar Sunway, 47500 Subang Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia","review_rating:3, text:The worse seafood I have ever eaten!
The lobster in salt is terribly salty. Presentation is nice for everything.
The steam fish is overcook.
The crabs platters only taste of curry powder.

We cannot finished the lobster  because of saltiness.

Definitely won't come back again | review_rating:5, text:I'm happy with their WhatsApp reservation service. They also provide useful information on price changes on their menu and share promotion meals through WhatsApp.

Finding the shop was a little tricky as it's located beside the Sunway Pinnacle building. You can park your car inside the Sunway Pinnacle to access the next building where the shop is located.

The food quality was excellent. I particularly enjoyed their fish head noodle with crab and clams. The broth was simply delicious. Their signature wine prawns were very fresh, and the wine was super tasty. However, their lala soup was too spicy for me to drink with just a normal spicy level. The crabs were fresh too. I will definitely visit again for their sushi meals. 🍣 | review_rating:1, text:I visited Yamaguchi Fish Market Restaurant for the Seafood High Tea and was quite disappointed with the food quality. Considering the price(RM102/pax), there are better options available elsewhere. The selection was very limited, with only 14 items to choose from. The salmon sashimi was not fresh, and despite my request for only two of each item, they served the full set. Additionally, drinks were not included in the buffet. The only positive aspect was the food presentation. | review_rating:4, text:Food super good. Drinks a bit overpriced. | review_rating:4, text:The second outlet of this restaurant, located in The Pinnacle Annexe, Sunway was opened in April 1, 2022 – the main branch, located in Kampung Pandan was launched in November 2015.
It occupies 2 floors and has lots of seating capacity.  The decoration is rather haphazard, not that it matters when it comes to food and drinks.  The latter I suspect is the main draw come dinner time.
While the menu is extensive (not using the word lightly here!) and mainly promotes Japanese cuisine, there is also a small section catered to Chinese food.  What was a surprise was that they have quite a good range of set lunches as well!  We order the Teppanyaki Beef set, Teppanyaki chicken set, the Sang Hah Mee and a Lala Noodles Soup.  While the lala noodles was just ordinary, both the beef and chicken were pretty good; generous chunks of meat carefully cooked, almost to perfection in teppanyaki sauce.  The dipping sauce completely complemented the meat, being slightly tangy and sweet.  A more familiar chili paste provided some burn, if required. It also came with a plate of rice, edamame, chawanmushi, tofu and miso soup.   The sang hah mee was generous, a large plate of egg noodles drenched with eggy sauce and topped with one very fresh fairly large prawn (into 2 halves).  One is also allowed add-ons, a soup, a drink and dessert at give away prices.  One normally do not expect the add-ons to taste really good, but the mushroom soup was lovely and the ice-lemon tea refreshingly good too!
Although the service is not top notch, who cares when the food, in my opinion is a steal, particularly the sang hah mee.
(Footnote: I recently ate at a “famous” old school sang hah mee stall in the centre of KL and had to pay triple the price for a prawn smaller than the one I had at Yamaguchi.  Even the serving of noodles was more generous!)",4.1,+60 12-968 7661,"Monday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Tuesday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Wednesday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Thursday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Friday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Saturday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Sunday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM"

The waiter was very professional and trying to make me feel comfortable. He was patiently explain to me about the menu. I also overheard him explain to an old couple behind me for quite a long time without getting annoyed. Big respect for the waiter patience.

The brand had redefined vegetarian cuisine by experimenting with original flavour and modern techniques, which is a blend of nature and flavoursome. Japanese cuisine is no stranger in Malaysia due to its distinctive tastes, attractive food presentations, and abundance of health benefits. In particular, the Japanese white rice was one of the key factor in contributing to overall health and longevity among the Japanese. The fact that Japanese rice contains a number of well-balanced of nutritional elements such as vegetable protein, dietary fibre, and low in calories. Thus, Japanese white rice being a staple food and pairing with other vegan dishes could promote overall health.
In Zen House, you must try out the Zen signature dishes curated just for you -Volcano Maki, Sashimi Moriawase, Omakase Moriawase, Cheese Shitake, and Zen House special salad. Besides, Zen House has the most creative Japanese vegan menu you can choose from: Appetizers, Salad, Temaki, Makimono, Hosomaki, Nigiri Sushi, Sushi Moriawase, Sashimi, Yakimono, Tempura, Nabemono, Noodles, Donmono, Teppanyaki, and Bento Sets.
As the brand had influenced by the culture of Japan, various vegan ingredients had been used to create a well-balanced Japanese diet. For example, Soba noodles are made up from buckwheat flour and offers beneficial manganese and gluten-free. On the other hand, Udon noodles are made up from thick wheat flour which promote healthy functioning of body cells and enzymes. Both Soba and Udon noodles are ideal for those opting for calorie-conscious diet. Furthermore, those who prefer crunchy texture should try out the wide choices of Vegetable tempura. It is a traditional Japanese style of cooking by deep-frying vegetables coated with light and eggless batter. Another dish that you shouldn’t miss out trying is the Vegan sashimi. The creative fusion of vegetables and other organic ingredients bring out the actual taste of fresh sashimi.

Finding vegetarian dining options beyond the typical Chinese restaurants can be challenging, so I was pleased to come across this establishment.

For my meal, I ordered an egg roll dish, okra skewer, and kimchi soup ramen. While the okra skewer may not have had the most visually appealing presentation when it arrived at the table, I was pleased to find that the okra was not overcooked. Instead, it maintained a satisfying crunchiness, which is how I prefer my okra to be prepared.

The kimchi ramen was decent overall, though I didn't particularly enjoy some of the ingredients, such as the bean sprouts and cabbage. Personal preferences aside, I appreciated the opportunity to find a suitable vegetarian restaurant option within the Sunway Pyramid mall.

Overall, I'm glad I was able to discover this Japanese vegetarian restaurant, as it provided a refreshing change of pace from the more common Chinese vegetarian offerings in the area.

I went to pick up an online order and unfortunately, there were some hiccups. After showering my order number, the staff went to look for my parcel and said it’s not there. Impossible, because I have a picture of it being delivered. After the second time, they managed to find my parcel. That was the only issue. While waiting for the staff to look for my item, I browsed around and they had a crazy sale. I ended up buying shoes because it was up to 70% off for it! | review_rating:5, text:Fantastic set up. This is the biggest and the most comprehensive outlet of Adidas. Best Adidas outlet in Malaysia without a doubt. The staffs are all pro-active and very knowledgeable about its products. It has 2 floors. Adidas Performance at the lower floor and Adidas Originals on the upper floor. Widest selection is available here and you get the latest products and customization here too 👍 highly recommended. Well done! | review_rating:1, text:I was at your adidas branch on the 26th of January on Sunday. Went there to purchase & customize a Jersey. STAFF no. 1 served me and went to confirm with the customization team which letters and numbers were available in stock. After confirming, STAFF no. 1 said that ONLY THE LETTER A was not in stock so he recommended me to purchase the letter at the Liverpool store opposite of adidas ( apparently he said that adidas customers do that when adidas runs out of letters or numbers ) So I went and purchase the letter A at the Liverpool store and went back to adidas to finally purchase the jersey. When I came back to the store I was served by STAFF NO. 2. STAFF NO. 2 brought me to the customization area to confirm the customization after I had told them the story of me purchasing the letter A. When I was at the customization counter suddenly the customization staff now said NUMBER 1 is also out of stock? To add another plot twist to the story after going back and forth with the staffs there, the same customization staff that initially SAID THE LETTER A and NUMBER 1 was unavailable suddenly said THE LETTER S is also out of stock when I showed him the player’s name and number for the second time? And what would have happened and how would it have been resolved if I went to the Liverpool store again and purchased the number 1 only for the hopeless customization staff to say that now the letter S is also out of stock? :D
( Do note that In the midst of encountering all these 3 incompetent staff and me going back and forth purchasing the unavailable letter at a different store I already showed them the Name and Number I wanted to put on the Jersey ) I don’t usually get triggered or mad at things like this as I am also working as a retail staff and I know how fussy certain customers can get sometimes but honestly it was your staffs fault for handing out wrong information over and over again. Wouldn’t it just be settled if any of the 3 staff actually would have just told me which letter and number was unavailable in the first place? Hence, today was probably the dumbest customer service I’ve encountered in my years of being a customer.

On a happy note, another Female customization staff was working on that day but she was at the upper floor as she was in charge of the redemption counter on that day ( based on the information given to me ) she was the one who apologized and insisted on reimbursing me for the initial letter A that I purchased. Kudos to her for helping out in settling the matter as the other Male customization staff kept laughing and saying that “I don’t know” a million times throughout the whole issue. Felt bad that she was the one who had to take out money from her own pocket when it was the initial 3 useless staff that caused the whole problem with their wrong information to begin with.

According to the female staff, she said that the customization team and the retail team aren’t linked together. So my opinion / suggestion is for both side to get correct information beforehand so something stupid like this does not happen again because it’s quite troublesome for your customers when each staff is giving out a different story every time. | review_rating:1, text:Had a sales guy ( Ashraf?

Not too busy. Had a simple black coffee hot. Not much of a serious coffee drinker; taste different from normal; amazing fragrance and deep taste. Enjoyed the coffee and ambience. Great port of call away from the busy mall scene outside. | review_rating:5, text:A very unique spot tucked away, offering a peaceful escape from the busy mall atmosphere. The coffee was fantastic – rich and full of flavor. However, found the chocolate roll to be a bit underwhelming, as it lacked the depth of flavors I was hoping for. Overall, it’s a great place to unwind with a good cup of coffee. | review_rating:4, text:I love the ambience of the place, very unique and is based on Japanese anime. The staffs were very friendly and helpful. They have desserts and drinks so I ordered the dark chocolate cake and a fujisan drink. Honestly, the dessert is just average but I like their drink. It is slightly pricey and the place is small but it's a good place for those who want to do quick office work. | review_rating:5, text:A cozy and quiet coffee shop hidden away in a busy mall. The coffee selection was great and I really enjoyed my cup! Great place to sit down and relax in the midst of a busy mall. Will visit again and definitely recommend to others. | review_rating:5, text:Price is on the higher end, the coffee was very good but a little too sour for my own preference, match latte was perfect.

Overall the foods are served with normal Vietnamese food standard. Not too bad also not super good.

Portion is enough. Simple meal. | review_rating:5, text:It’s my first time to visit. The food tastes good to me because it’s not too spicy. The Vietnamese bread is a bit hard, but the grilled pork chop inside tastes good. I like the soup to be hot enough but not too heavy on MSG. I love the lemongrass and ginger tea with its strong ginger flavor. Spicy, the service staff are very polite, especially the male waiter at the cash register. He deserves praise for his politeness and patience. The overall meal is enjoyable and delicious to me. | review_rating:5, text:Came here for lunch on weekday, quite packed during lunch hour.

Their food is very good is all i can say, i did not have high expection for this place but wow. Everything is just good, even their service is good also. One thing that let me down is their Iced Dripped Coffee is not that strong. I wish they would let us enjoy the dripping process and allow us to pour into the cup ourselves to adjust the thickness and flavour we want.

Will come again for sure | review_rating:4, text:Visited twice, the first visit was a great experience, food was served quickly despite it was full house on a weekend. Food portion was big, and tasted delicious. Recommend the avocado coffee, we requested for less sugar and it was yummy.

Second visit was quite a let down. We ordered the banh mi pork chop, but the pork had a very strong strange taste, it’s the taste everybody is afraid of when eating pork. We couldn’t even finish.

I will return to this restaurant but I might not order pork dishes anymore | review_rating:4, text:We came here for our reunion lunch, oh gosh their beef balls really gave my sis and i a huge surprise! Both of our first visit and we were so in love with their beef balls! Lemon grass drinks definitely not our taste…… Gonna try out their pillow rice balls on our next visit.",4.3,+60 3-5611 2226,"Monday: 11:00 AM – 9:30 PM, Tuesday: 11:00 AM – 9:30 PM, Wednesday: 11:00 AM – 9:30 PM, Thursday: 11:00 AM – 9:30 PM, Friday: 11:00 AM – 9:30 PM, Saturday: 10:00 AM – 9:30 PM, Sunday: 10:00 AM – 9:30 PM"
